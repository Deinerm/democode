	abstract = {For the first time, an in vivo sampling mode of direct immersion–solid phase microextraction (DI-SPME) was employed to capture the metabolome of living plant specimens, using apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) as a model system. Metabolites were extracted from apple tissues and introduced by thermal desorption into a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry instrument. The feasibility of this sampling approach, based on exploitation of microextraction principles, including negligible depletion of free analyte concentrations, solventless sampling and sample preparation, and on-site compatibility, was determined in global metabolite analysis. Rather than adopting an approach of traditional sample preparation, requiring metabolism quenching and laborious sample preparation, the objective of the study was to capture the metabolome in vivo, evaluate the feasibility of the approach to provide unbiased extraction coverage, and compare analytical precision when different SPME sampling modes are employed. The potential of in vivo DI-SPME in quantitative plant metabolomics was assessed by evaluating changes in metabolic fingerprints in response to fruit maturation. The in vivo SPME sampling approach has been demonstrated as capable of sampling living systems with high reproducibility, considering that nearly 50\% of hundreds of evaluated compounds included in the determination of analytical performance met the 15\% RSD FDA criterion. Esters were extracted with high repeatability (\% RSD for hexyl butanoate and butyl butanoate of 16.5 and 5.9, respectively, from 9 determinations in 3 apples) and found to be upregulated in response to apple fruit maturation.},

The determination of the metabolomic profile – the metabolome – has multiple applications in many biological sciences, including the developing of new diagnostic tools in medicine. Recent technological advances in nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry are significantly improving our capacity to obtain more data from each biological sample. Consequently, there is a need for fast and accurate statistical and bioinformatic tools that can deal with the complexity and volume of the data generated in metabolomic studies. In this review, we provide an update of the most commonly used analytical methods in metabolomics, starting from raw data processing and ending with pathway analysis and biomarker identification.

	abstract = {It is vital to pay much attention to the design of extraction methods developed for plant metabolomics, as any non-extracted or converted metabolites will greatly affect the overall quality of the metabolomics study. Method validation is however often omitted in plant metabolome studies, as the well-established methodologies for classical targeted analyses such as recovery optimization cannot be strictly applied. The aim of the present study is to thoroughly evaluate state-of-the-art comprehensive extraction protocols for plant metabolomics with liquid chromatography-photodiode array-accurate mass mass spectrometry (LC-PDA-amMS) by bridging the gap with method validation.

Validation of an extraction protocol in untargeted plant metabolomics should ideally be accomplished by validating the protocol for all possible outcomes, i.e. for all secondary metabolites potentially present in the plant. In an effort to approach this ideal validation scenario, two plant matrices were selected based on their wide versatility of phytochemicals: meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) for its polyphenols content, and spicy paprika powder (from the genus Capsicum) for its apolar phytochemicals content (carotenoids, phytosterols, capsaicinoids). These matrices were extracted with comprehensive extraction protocols adapted from literature and analysed with a generic LC-PDA-amMS characterization platform that was previously validated for broad range phytochemical analysis. The performance of the comprehensive sample preparation protocols was assessed based on extraction efficiency, repeatability and intermediate precision and on ionization suppression/enhancement evaluation.

The manuscript elaborates on the finding that none of the extraction methods allowed to exhaustively extract the metabolites. Furthermore, it is shown that depending on the extraction conditions enzymatic degradation mechanisms can occur. Investigation of the fractions obtained with the different extraction methods revealed a low resolving power for phytochemicals for all methods. Nevertheless, an overall good repeatability was observed for all extraction methods, which is essential to allow direct comparison between samples. In summary, no single procedure outperforms the others and compromises will have to be made during method selection.},

	abstract = {Metabolomic data are frequently acquired using chromatographically coupled mass spectrometry (MS) platforms. For such datasets, the first step in data analysis relies on feature detection, where a feature is defined by a mass and retention time. While a feature typically is derived from a single compound, a spectrum of mass signals is more a more-accurate representation of the mass spectrometric signal for a given metabolite. Here, we report a novel feature grouping method that operates in an unsupervised manner to group signals from MS data into spectra without relying on predictability of the in-source phenomenon. We additionally address a fundamental bottleneck in metabolomics, annotation of MS level signals, by incorporating indiscriminant MS/MS (idMS/MS) data implicitly: feature detection is performed on both MS and idMS/MS data, and feature–feature relationships are determined simultaneously from the MS and idMS/MS data. This approach facilitates identification of metabolites using in-source MS and/or idMS/MS spectra from a single experiment, reduces quantitative analytical variation compared to single-feature measures, and decreases false positive annotations of unpredictable phenomenon as novel compounds. This tool is released as a freely available R package, called RAMClustR, and is sufficiently versatile to group features from any chromatographic-spectrometric platform or feature-finding software.},

However, while ESI is a soft ionization technique, in-source phenomena including multimerization, nonproton cation adduction, and in-source fragmentation complicate interpretation of MS data. Here, we report chromatographic and mass spectrometric behavior of 904 authentic standards collected under conditions identical to a typical nontargeted profiling experiment. The data illustrate that the often high level of complexity in MS spectra is likely to result in misinterpretation during the annotation phase of the experiment and a large overestimation of the number of compounds detected. However, our analysis of this MS spectral library data indicates that in-source phenomena are not random but depend at least in part on chemical structure. These nonrandom patterns enabled predictions to be made as to which in-source signals are likely to be observed for a given compound. Using the authentic standard spectra as a training set, we modeled the in-source phenomena for all compounds in the Human Metabolome Database to generate a theoretical in-source spectrum and retention time library. A novel spectral similarity matching platform was developed to facilitate efficient spectral searching for nontargeted profiling applications. Taken together, this collection of experimental spectral data, predictive modeling, and informatic tools enables more efficient, reliable, and transparent metabolite annotation.},

	abstract = {Liquid chromatography (LC) with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) represents a powerful technique for the identification and/or confirmation of small molecules, i.e. drugs, metabolites or contaminants, in different matrices. However, reliability of analyte identification by HRMS is being challenged by the uncertainty that affects the exact mass measurement. This parameter, characterized by accuracy and precision, is influenced by sample matrix and interferent compounds so that questions about how to develop and validate reliable LC-HRMS-based methods are being raised. Experimental approaches for studying the effects of various key factors influencing mass accuracy on low-molecular weight compounds (MW {\textless} 150 Da) when using a quadrupole-time-of-flight (QTOF) mass analyzer were described. Biogenic amines in human plasma were considered for the purpose and the effects of peak shape, ion abundance, resolution and data processing on accurate mass measurements of the analytes were evaluated. In addition, the influence of the matrix on the uncertainty associated with their identification and quantitation is discussed. A critical evaluation on the calculation of the limits of detection was carried out, considering the uncertainty associated with exact mass measurement of HRMS-based methods. The minimum concentration level of the analytes that was able to provide a statistical error lower than 5 ppm in terms of precision was 10 times higher than those calculated with S/N = 3, thus suggesting the importance of considering both components of exact mass measurement uncertainty in the evaluation of the limit of detection.

Tracking the dynamic metabolic change in survival and non-survival rats in the early stage may reveal new system information to understand the inter-individual variation in response to LPS. As the time-resolved datasets are very complex and no single method can elucidate the problem clearly and comprehensively, the static and dynamic metabolomics methods were employed in combination as cross-validation. Intriguingly, some common results have been observed. Lipids were the main different metabolites between survival and non-survival rats in pre-dose serum and in the early stage of infection with LPS. The LPS treatment led to S-adenosly-methionine and total cysteine individual difference in early stage, and subsequent significant perturbations in energy metabolism and oxidative stress. Furthermore, cytokine profiles were analyzed to identify potential biological associations between cytokines and specific metabolites. Our collective findings may provide some heuristic guidance for elucidating the underlying mechanism of individual difference in LPS-mediated disease.},

However, the use of GC-EI MS in untargeted metabolomics produces large and complex data sets characterized by coeluting compounds and extensive fragmentation of molecular ions caused by the hard electron ionization. In order to identify and extract quantitative information on metabolites across multiple biological samples, integrated computational workflows for data processing are needed. Here we introduce eRah, a free computational tool written in the open language R composed of five core functions: (i) noise filtering and baseline removal of GC/MS chromatograms, (ii) an innovative compound deconvolution process using multivariate analysis techniques based on compound match by local covariance (CMLC) and orthogonal signal deconvolution (OSD), (iii) alignment of mass spectra across samples, (iv) missing compound recovery, and (v) identification of metabolites by spectral library matching using publicly available mass spectra. eRah outputs a table with compound names, matching scores and the integrated area of compounds for each sample. The automated capabilities of eRah are demonstrated by the analysis of GC-time-of-flight (TOF) MS data from plasma samples of adolescents with hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess and healthy controls. The quantitative results of eRah are compared to centWave, the peak-picking algorithm implemented in the widely used XCMS package, MetAlign, and ChromaTOF software. Significantly dysregulated metabolites are further validated using pure standards and targeted analysis by GC-triple quadrupole (QqQ) MS, LC-QqQ, and NMR. eRah is freely available at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=erah.},

Several artefacts have been identified during the acquisition step in large LC/MS metabolomics experiments, including ion suppression, carryover or changes in the sensitivity and intensity. Several sources have been pointed out as responsible for these effects. In this context, the drift effects of the peak intensity is one of the most frequent and may even constitute the main source of variance in the data, resulting in misleading statistical results when the samples are analysed. In this article, we propose the introduction of a methodology based on a common variance analysis before the data normalization to address this issue. This methodology was tested and compared with four other methods by calculating the Dunn and Silhouette indices of the quality control classes. The results showed that our proposed methodology performed better than any of the other four methods. As far as we know, this is the first time that this kind of approach has been applied in the metabolomics context.

	abstract = {Oxidised lipids, covering enzymatic and auto-oxidation-synthesised mediators, are important signalling metabolites in inflammation while also providing a readout for oxidative stress, both of which are prominent physiological processes in a plethora of diseases. Excretion of these metabolites via urine is enhanced through the phase-II conjugation with glucuronic acid, resulting in increased hydrophilicity of these lipid mediators. Here, we developed a bovine liver-β-glucuronidase hydrolysing sample preparation method, using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to analyse the total urinary oxidised lipid profile including the prostaglandins, isoprostanes, dihydroxy-fatty acids, hydroxy-fatty acids and the nitro-fatty acids. Our method detected more than 70 oxidised lipids biosynthesised from two non-enzymatic and three enzymatic pathways in urine samples. The total oxidised lipid profiling method was developed and validated for human urine and was demonstrated for urine samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Pro-inflammatory mediators PGF2α and PGF3α and oxidative stress markers iPF2α- IV, 11-HETE and 14-HDoHE were positively associated with improvement of disease activity score. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory nitro-fatty acids were negatively associated with baseline disease activity. In conclusion, the developed methodology expands the current metabolic profiling of oxidised lipids in urine, and its application will enhance our understanding of the role these bioactive metabolites play in health and disease.},

	abstract = {Human biomonitoring is the assessment of actual internal contamination of chemicals by measuring exposure markers, chemicals or their metabolites, in human urine, blood, serum, and other body fluids. However, the metabolism of chemicals within an organism is extremely complex. Therefore, the identification of metabolites is often difficult and laborious. Several untargeted metabolomics methods have been developed to perform objective searching/filtering of accurate-mass-based LC-MS data to facilitate metabolite identification. In this study, three metabolomics data processing approaches were used for chemical exposure marker discovery in urine with an LTQ-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) dataset; di-isononyl phthalate (DINP) was used as an example. The data processing techniques included the SMAIT, mass defect filtering (MDF), and XCMS Online. Sixteen, 83, and 139 probable DINP metabolite signals were obtained using the SMAIT, MDF, and XCMS procedures, respectively. Fourteen probable metabolite signals mined simultaneously by the three metabolomics approaches were confirmed as DINP metabolites by structural information provided by LC-MS/MS. Among them, 13 probable metabolite signals were validated as exposure-related markers in a rat model. Six (m/z 319.155, 361.127, 373.126, 389.157, 437.112 and 443.130) of the 13 exposure-related DINP metabolite signals have not previously been reported in the literature. Our data indicate that SMAIT provided an efficient method to discover effectively and systematically urinary exposure markers of toxicant. The DINP metabolism information can provide valuable information for further investigations of DINP toxicity, toxicokinetics, exposure assessment, and human health effects.},

However, a global view of arsenic-induced male reproductive toxicity is still lack, and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Our results revealed that arsenic exposure decreased testosterone level and reduced sperm quality in rats. By conducting an integrated proteomics and metabolomics analysis, the present study aims to investigate the global influence of arsenic exposure on the proteome and metabolome in rat testis. The abundance of 70 proteins (36 up-regulated and 34 down-regulated) and 13 metabolites (8 increased and 5 decreased) were found to be significantly altered by arsenic treatment. Among these, 19 proteins and 2 metabolites were specifically related to male reproductive system development and function, including spermatogenesis, sperm function and fertilization, fertility, internal genitalia development, and mating behavior. It is further proposed that arsenic mainly impaired spermatogenesis and fertilization via aberrant modulation of these male reproduction-related proteins and metabolites, which may be mediated by the ERK/AKT/NF-κB-dependent signaling pathway. Overall, these findings will aid our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for arsenic-induced male reproductive toxicity, and from such studies useful biomarkers indicative of arsenic exposure could be discovered.},

	abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or “batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes () to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

	abstract = {Instrumental developments in sensitivity and selectivity boost the application of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in metabolomics. Gradual changes in the LC-MS instrumental response (i.e. intra-batch effect) are often unavoidable and they reduce the repeatability and reproducibility of the analysis, decrease the power to detect biological responses and hinder the interpretation of the information provided. Because of that, there is interest in the development of chemometric techniques for the post-acquisition correction of batch effects. In this work, the use of quality control (QC) samples and support vector regression (QC-SVRC) and a radial basis function kernel is proposed to correct intra-batch effects. The repeated analysis of a single sample is used for the assessment of both the correction accuracy and the effect of the distribution of QC samples throughout the batch. The QC-SVRC method is evaluated and compared with a recently developed method based on QC samples and robust cubic smoothing splines (QC-RSC). The results show that QC-SVRC slightly outperformed QC-RSC and allows a straightforward fitting of the SVRC parameters to the instrument performance by using the ε-insensitive loss parameter.},

In any given study there will be many other variables at play, such as the effects of age and sex on the disease. We show that in studies where the expression levels of thousands of genes are measured at once, these issues become surprisingly critical. Due to the complexity of our genomes, environment, and demographic features, there are many sources of variation when analyzing gene expression levels. In any given study, it is impossible to measure every single variable that may be influencing how our genes are expressed. Despite this, we show that by considering all expression levels simultaneously, one can actually recover the effects of these important missed variables and essentially produce an analysis as if all relevant variables were included. As opposed to traditional studies, the massive amount of data available in this setting is what makes the method, called surrogate variable analysis, possible. We hypothesize that surrogate variable analysis will be useful in many large-scale gene expression studies.},

	abstract = {In this study, a novel untargeted metabolomics-driven strategy based on LC-MS was used to rapidly screen and identify the absorbed components and metabolites of Zhi-Zi-Hou-Po decoction (ZZHPD) in rat plasma. The plasma sample was obtained from orbital venous of rats after oral administration and pretreated by protein precipitation before analysis. All sample data from total ion chromatograms (TICs) of LC-TOF/MS were aligned and peak picked by XCMS and MetAlign combined to extract three-dimensional datasets (peak code, tR–m/z pairs and ion intensity). Xenobiotics in rat plasma were differentiated from endogenous components by multivariate statistical analysis and then divided into prototype compounds and metabolites by comparing tR–m/z with the chemical compounds of ZZHPD. Combined with fragment ions and structure information of LC-TSQ/MS, a total of 61 compounds, including 35 prototype compounds and 26 metabolites, were rapidly identified or tentatively characterized in rat plasma. Results indicated that iridoid glycosides, monoterpenoids, flavonoids, and lignans were the main absorbed chemical components of ZZHPD. Glucuronidation and sulfation were the main metabolic pathways of ZZHPD compounds in vivo. In addition, there were ring-opening reactions and reduction reactions for iridoid glycosides, hydrolysis for flavonoids, as well as hydroxylation and stereoscopic conversion reactions for lignans. This study offers a systematically applicable approach for rapid screening and identification of xenobiotics and metabolites derived from multi-herb prescription in vivo, and provides useful information for ascertaining bioactive ingredients and action mechanisms of ZZHPD.Graphical AbstractDiagram of untargeted metabolomics-driven strategy for ZZHPD in rat plasma},

	abstract = {The aim of untargeted metabolomics is to profile as many metabolites as possible, yet a major challenge is comparing experimental method performance on the basis of metabolome coverage. To date, most published approaches have compared experimental methods by counting the total number of features detected. Due to artifactual interference, however, this number is highly variable and therefore is a poor metric for comparing metabolomic methods. Here we introduce an alternative approach to benchmarking metabolome coverage which relies on mixed Escherichia coli extracts from cells cultured in regular and 13C-enriched media. After mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of these extracts, we “credential” features arising from E. coli metabolites on the basis of isotope spacing and intensity. This credentialing platform enables us to accurately compare the number of nonartifactual features yielded by different experimental approaches. We highlight the value of our platform by reoptimizing a published untargeted metabolomic method for XCMS data processing. Compared to the published parameters, the new XCMS parameters decrease the total number of features by 15\% (a reduction in noise features) while increasing the number of true metabolites detected and grouped by 20\%. Our credentialing platform relies on easily generated E. coli samples and a simple software algorithm that is freely available on our laboratory Web site (http://pattilab.wustl.edu/software/credential/). We have validated the credentialing platform with reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography as well as Agilent, Thermo Scientific, AB SCIEX, and LECO mass spectrometers. Thus, the credentialing platform can readily be applied by any laboratory to optimize their untargeted metabolomic pipeline for metabolite extraction, chromatographic separation, mass spectrometric detection, and bioinformatic processing.},

	abstract = {Bariatric surgery is currently one of the most effective treatments for obesity and leads to significant weight reduction, improved cardiovascular risk factors and overall survival in treated patients. To date, most studies focused on short-term effects of bariatric surgery on the metabolic profile and found high variation in the individual responses to surgery. The aim of this study was to identify relevant metabolic changes not only shortly after bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) but also up to one year after the intervention by using untargeted metabolomics. 132 serum samples taken from 44 patients before surgery, after hospital discharge (1–3 weeks after surgery) and at a 1-year follow-up during a prospective study (NCT01271062) performed at two study centers (Austria and Switzerland). The samples included 24 patients with type 2 diabetes at baseline, thereof 9 with diabetes remission after one year. The samples were analyzed by using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS, HILIC-QExactive). Raw data was processed with XCMS and drift-corrected through quantile regression based on quality controls. 177 relevant metabolic features were selected through Random Forests and univariate testing and 36 metabolites were identified. Identified metabolites included trimethylamine- N -oxide, alanine, phenylalanine and indoxyl-sulfate which are known markers for cardiovascular risk. In addition we found a significant decrease in alanine after one year in the group of patients with diabetes remission relative to non-remission. Our analysis highlights the importance of assessing multiple points in time in subjects undergoing bariatric surgery to enable the identification of biomarkers for treatment response, cardiovascular benefit and diabetes remission. Key-findings include different trend pattern over time for various metabolites and demonstrated that short term changes should not necessarily be used to identify important long term effects of bariatric surgery.},

Despite the increased accuracy from the original version to version 2.0 in terms of extracting metabolite information for identification and quantitation, ADAP-GC 2.0 requires appropriate specification of a number of parameters and has difficulty in extracting information on compounds that are in low concentration. To overcome these two limitations, ADAP-GC 3.0 was developed to improve both the robustness and sensitivity of compound detection. In this paper, we report how these goals were achieved and compare ADAP-GC 3.0 against three other software tools including ChromaTOF, AnalyzerPro, and AMDIS that are widely used in the metabolomics community.},

It is designed to identify the differences between metabolic profiles across multiple sample groups (e.g., 'healthy' versus 'active disease' versus 'inactive disease'). Although performing pairwise comparisons alone can provide physiologically relevant data, these experiments often result in hundreds of differences, and comparison with additional biologically meaningful sample groups can allow for substantial data reduction. By performing second-order (meta-) analysis, metaXCMS facilitates the prioritization of interesting metabolite features from large untargeted metabolomic data sets before the rate-limiting step of structural identification. Here we provide a detailed step-by-step protocol for going from raw mass spectrometry data to metaXCMS results, visualized as Venn diagrams and exported Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. There is no upper limit to the number of sample groups or individual samples that can be compared with the software, and data from most commercial mass spectrometers are supported.

	abstract = {Background   Optimizing resuscitation is important to prevent morbidity and mortality from perinatal asphyxia. The metabolism of cells and tissues is severely disturbed during asphyxia and resuscitation, and metabolomic analyses provide a snapshot of many small molecular weight metabolites in body fluids or tissues. In this study metabolomics profiles were studied in newborn pigs that were asphyxiated and resuscitated using different protocols to identify biomarkers for subject characterization, intervention effects and possibly prognosis.       Methods   A total of 125 newborn Noroc pigs were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and inflicted progressive asphyxia until asystole. Pigs were randomized to resuscitation with a FiO 2  0.21 or 1.0, different duration of ventilation before initiation of chest compressions (CC), and different CC to ventilation ratios. Plasma and urine samples were obtained at baseline, and 2 h and 4 h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC, heart rate \&gt; = 100 bpm). Metabolomics profiles of the samples were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.       Results   Plasma and urine showed severe metabolic alterations consistent with hypoxia and acidosis 2 h and 4 h after ROSC. Baseline plasma hypoxanthine and lipoprotein concentrations were inversely correlated to the duration of hypoxia sustained before asystole occurred, but there was no evidence for a differential metabolic response to the different resuscitation protocols or in terms of survival.       Conclusions   Metabolic profiles of asphyxiated newborn pigs showed severe metabolic alterations. Consistent with previously published reports, we found no evidence of differences between established and alternative resuscitation protocols. Lactate and pyruvate may have a prognostic value, but have to be independently confirmed.},

Therefore, of fundamental interest for every enzyme is the elucidation of its natural substrates. Here, we describe a general strategy for identifying endogenous substrates of enzymes by untargeted liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry (LC−MS) analysis of tissue metabolomes from wild-type and enzyme-inactivated organisms. We use this method to discover several brain lipids regulated by the mammalian enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in vivo, including known signaling molecules (e.g., the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide) and a novel family of nervous system-enriched natural products, the taurine-conjugated fatty acids. Remarkably, the relative hydrolytic activity that FAAH exhibited for lipid metabolites in vitro was not predictive of the identity of specific FAAH substrates in vivo. Thus, global metabolite profiling establishes unanticipated connections between the proteome and metabolome that enable assignment of an enzyme's unique biochemical functions in vivo.},

Here, we aim to determine if processing reduces the toxicity of raw PR, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of raw PR-induced toxicities and the toxicity-reducing effect of processing. Biochemical and histopathological approaches were used to evaluate the toxicities of raw and processed PR. Rat serum metabolites were analyzed by LC-TOF-MS. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the metabolomics data highlighted the biological pathways and network functions involved in raw PR-induced toxicities and the toxicity-reducing effect of processing, which were verified by molecular approaches. Results showed that raw PR caused cardiotoxicity, and processing reduced the toxicity. Inhibition of mTOR signaling and activation of the TGF-β pathway contributed to raw PR-induced cardiotoxicity, and free radical scavenging might be responsible for the toxicity-reducing effect of processing. Our data shed new light on the mechanisms of raw PR-induced cardiotoxicity and the toxicity-reducing effect of processing. This study provides scientific justifications for the traditional processing theory of PR, and should help in optimizing the processing protocol and clinical combinational application of PR.},

Linear discriminant analysis was used to classify samples on the score plots.  Using this approach, the effect of 5-fluorouracil treatment could be successfully discriminated at high discrimination rates.  Moreover, several amino acids were extracted from corresponding loading plots as candidate markers for distinguishing the effects of the 5-fluorouracil treatment or tumor microenvironmental conditions.

By integrated analysis of MS1 abundances and MS/MS spectra, the identification of regulated metabolite families is achieved. This approach offers a global view on metabolic regulation in comparative metabolomics. We implemented our approach in the web application “MetFamily”, which is freely available at http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/MetFamily/. MetFamily provides a dynamic link between the patterns based on MS1-signal intensity and the corresponding structural similarity at the MS/MS level. Structurally related metabolites are annotated as metabolite families based on a hierarchical cluster analysis of measured MS/MS spectra. Joint examination with principal component analysis of MS1 patterns, where this annotation is preserved in the loadings, facilitates the interpretation of comparative metabolomics data at the level of metabolite families.

	abstract = {Background
The statistical analysis of immunological data may be complicated because precise quantitative levels cannot always be determined. Values below a given detection limit may not be observed (nondetects), and data with nondetects are called left-censored. Since nondetects cannot be considered as missing at random, a statistician faced with data containing these nondetects must decide how to combine nondetects with detects. Till now, the common practice is to impute each nondetect with a single value such as a half of the detection limit, and to conduct ordinary regression analysis. The first aim of this paper is to give an overview of methods to analyze, and to provide new methods handling censored data other than an (ordinary) linear regression. The second aim is to compare these methods by simulation studies based on real data.

Results
We compared six new and existing methods: deletion of nondetects, single substitution, extrapolation by regression on order statistics, multiple imputation using maximum likelihood estimation, tobit regression, and logistic regression. The deletion and extrapolation by regression on order statistics methods gave biased parameter estimates. The single substitution method underestimated variances, and logistic regression suffered loss of power. Based on simulation studies, we found that tobit regression performed well when the proportion of nondetects was less than 30\%, and that taken together the multiple imputation method performed best.

Conclusion
Based on simulation studies, the newly developed multiple imputation method performed consistently well under different scenarios of various proportion of nondetects, sample sizes and even in the presence of heteroscedastic errors.},

Combinations of multiple batches or data sets in large cross-sectional epidemiology studies are frequently utilized in metabolomics, but various systematic biases can introduce both batch and injection order effects and often require proper calibrations prior to chemometric analyses. We present a novel algorithm, Batch Normalizer, to calibrate large scale metabolomic data. Batch Normalizer utilizes a regression model with consideration of the total abundance of each sample to improve its calibration performance, and it is able to remove both batch effect and injection order effects. This calibration method was tested using liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS) chromatograms of 228 plasma samples and 23 pooled quality control (QC) samples. We evaluated the performance of Batch Normalizer by examining the distribution of relative standard deviation (RSD) for all peaks detected in the pooled QC samples, the average Pearson correlation coefficients for all peaks between any two of QC samples, and the distribution of QC samples in the scores plot of a principal component analysis (PCA). After calibration by Batch Normalizer, the number of peaks in QC samples with RSD less than 15\% increased from 11 to 914, all of the QC samples were closely clustered in PCA scores plot, and the average Pearson correlation coefficients for all peaks of QC samples increased from 0.938 to 0.976. This method was compared to 7 commonly used calibration methods. We discovered that using Batch Normalizer to calibrate LC/TOF-MS data produces the best calibration results.},

	abstract = {IntroductionBatch effects in large untargeted metabolomics experiments are almost unavoidable, especially when sensitive detection techniques like mass spectrometry (MS) are employed. In order to obtain peak intensities that are comparable across all batches, corrections need to be performed. Since non-detects, i.e., signals with an intensity too low to be detected with certainty, are common in metabolomics studies, the batch correction methods need to take these into account. ObjectivesThis paper aims to compare several batch correction methods, and investigates the effect of different strategies for handling non-detects.MethodsBatch correction methods usually consist of regression models, possibly also accounting for trends within batches. To fit these models quality control samples (QCs), injected at regular intervals, can be used. Also study samples can be used, provided that the injection order is properly randomized. Normalization methods, not using information on batch labels or injection order, can correct for batch effects as well. Introducing two easy-to-use quality criteria, we assess the merits of these batch correction strategies using three large LC–MS and GC–MS data sets of samples from Arabidopsis thaliana.ResultsThe three data sets have very different characteristics, leading to clearly distinct behaviour of the batch correction strategies studied. Explicit inclusion of information on batch and injection order in general leads to very good corrections; when enough QCs are available, also general normalization approaches perform well. Several approaches are shown to be able to handle non-detects—replacing them with very small numbers such as zero seems the worst of the approaches considered.ConclusionThe use of quality control samples for batch correction leads to good results when enough QCs are available. If an experiment is properly set up, batch correction using the study samples usually leads to a similar high-quality correction, but has the advantage that more metabolites are corrected. The strategy for handling non-detects is important: choosing small values like zero can lead to suboptimal batch corrections.},

Typically employed reversed-phase (RP) methods fail to target polar metabolites, but the introduction of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is slow due to perceived issues of reproducibility and ruggedness and a limited understanding of the complex retention mechanisms. In this study, we present a comparison of the chromatographic performance of a traditional RP-C18 column with zwitterionic, amide-, alkyl diol-, and aminoalkyl-based HILIC and mixed-mode columns. Our metabolite library represents one of the largest analyte sets available and consists of 764 authentic metabolite standards, including amino acids, nucleotides, sugars, and other metabolites, representing all major biological pathways and commonly observed exogenous metabolites (drugs). The coverage, retention patterns, and selectivity of the individual methods are highly diverse even between conceptually related HILIC methods. Furthermore, we show that HILIC sorbents having highly orthogonal selectivity and specificity enhance the coverage of major metabolite groups in (semi-) targeted applications compared to RP. Finally, we discuss issues encountered in the analysis of biological samples based on the results obtained with human plasma extracts. Our results demonstrate that fast and highly reproducible separations on zwitterionic columns are feasible, but knowledge of analyte properties is essential to avoid chromatographic bias and exclusion of key analytes in metabolomics studies.Graphical AbstractThe chromatographic parameters of 764 authentic metabolite standards provide the basis for a comparison of coverage, selectivity and orthogonality of 7 reversed-phase (RP), mixed-mode (MM) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) methods},

With continuing advances in metabolomics along with constant user feedback, it became clear that a substantial upgrade to the original server was necessary. MetaboAnalyst 2.0, which is the successor to MetaboAnalyst, represents just such an upgrade. MetaboAnalyst 2.0 now contains dozens of new features and functions including new procedures for data filtering, data editing and data normalization. It also supports multi-group data analysis, two-factor analysis as well as time-series data analysis. These new functions have also been supplemented with: (i) a quality-control module that allows users to evaluate their data quality before conducting any analysis, (ii) a functional enrichment analysis module that allows users to identify biologically meaningful patterns using metabolite set enrichment analysis and (iii) a metabolic pathway analysis module that allows users to perform pathway analysis and visualization for 15 different model organisms. In developing MetaboAnalyst 2.0 we have also substantially improved its graphical presentation tools. All images are now generated using anti-aliasing and are available over a range of resolutions, sizes and formats (PNG, TIFF, PDF, PostScript, or SVG). To improve its performance, MetaboAnalyst 2.0 is now hosted on a much more powerful server with substantially modified code to take advantage the server’s multi-core CPUs for computationally intensive tasks. MetaboAnalyst 2.0 also maintains a collection of 50 or more FAQs and more than a dozen tutorials compiled from user queries and requests. A downloadable version of MetaboAnalyst 2.0, along detailed instructions for local installation is now available as well.},

It is frequently used in biomarker identification and the metabolic profiling of cells, tissues or organisms. The data processing challenges in metabolomics are quite unique and often require specialized (or expensive) data analysis software and a detailed knowledge of cheminformatics, bioinformatics and statistics. In an effort to simplify metabolomic data analysis while at the same time improving user accessibility, we have developed a freely accessible, easy-to-use web server for metabolomic data analysis called MetaboAnalyst. Fundamentally, MetaboAnalyst is a web-based metabolomic data processing tool not unlike many of today's web-based microarray analysis packages. It accepts a variety of input data (NMR peak lists, binned spectra, MS peak lists, compound/concentration data) in a wide variety of formats. It also offers a number of options for metabolomic data processing, data normalization, multivariate statistical analysis, graphing, metabolite identification and pathway mapping. In particular, MetaboAnalyst supports such techniques as: fold change analysis, t-tests, PCA, PLS-DA, hierarchical clustering and a number of more sophisticated statistical or machine learning methods. It also employs a large library of reference spectra to facilitate compound identification from most kinds of input spectra. MetaboAnalyst guides users through a step-by-step analysis pipeline using a variety of menus, information hyperlinks and check boxes. Upon completion, the server generates a detailed report describing each method used, embedded with graphical and tabular outputs. MetaboAnalyst is capable of handling most kinds of metabolomic data and was designed to perform most of the common kinds of metabolomic data analyses.

Thus, we applied a metabolomics approach to analyze urinary metabolites in three groups of participants: patients with polysomnography (PSG)-confirmed OSA, simple snorers (SS), and normal subjects. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used. A total of 21 and 31 metabolites were differentially expressed in the SS and OSA groups, respectively. Patients with OSA had 18 metabolites different from those with SS. Of the 56 metabolites detected among the 3 groups, 24 were consistently higher or lower. A receiver operator curve analysis revealed that the combination of 4-hydroxypentenoic acid, arabinose, glycochenodeoxycholate-3-sulfate, isoleucine, serine, and xanthine produced a moderate diagnostic score with a sensitivity (specificity) of 75\% (78\%) for distinguishing OSA from those without OSA. The combination of 4-hydroxypentenoic acid, 5-dihydrotestosterone sulfate, serine, spermine, and xanthine distinguished OSA from SS with a sensitivity of 85\% and specificity of 80\%. Multiple metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with SS and OSA were identified using the metabolomics approach, and the altered metabolite signatures could potentially serve as an alternative diagnostic method to PSG.},

Our work evaluated the feasibility of employing urine metabolomics for the diagnosis and staging of ESCC. The satisfactory classification between the healthy controls and ESCC patients was obtained using the MVDA model, and obvious classification of early-stage and advanced-stage patients was also observed. The results suggest that the combination of LC-MS analysis and MVDA may have potential applications for ESCC diagnosis and staging. We then conducted LC-MS/MS experiments to identify the potential biomarkers with large contributions to the discrimination. A total of 83 potential diagnostic biomarkers for ESCC were screened out, and 19 potential biomarkers were identified; the variations between the differences in staging using these potential biomarkers were further analyzed. These biomarkers may not be unique to ESCCs, but instead result from any malignant disease. To further elucidate the pathophysiology of ESCC, we studied related metabolic pathways and found that ESCC is associated with perturbations of fatty acid β-oxidation and the metabolism of amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines.},

The biological and toxicological characteristics of enantiomers of chiral PCBs may differ, but these enantioselective effects of PCBs have not been fully characterized. In this study, we performed metabolomics analysis, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to investigate the enantioselective toxic effects of PCB95 in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) embryos after exposure to three dose levels of 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L for 72 h. Multivariate analysis directly reflected the metabolic perturbations caused by PCB95. The effects of (-)-PCB95 and (+)-PCB95 were more prominent than those of the racemate in zebrafish embryos. A total of 26 endogenous metabolites were selected as potential marker metabolites with variable importance at projection values larger than 1 and significant differences ( p \&lt;0.05). These metabolites included amino acids, organic acids, nucleosides, betaine, and choline. The changes in these biomarkers were dependent on the enantiomer-specific structures of PCB95. Fifteen metabolic pathways were significantly affected, and several nervous and immune system-related metabolites were significantly validated after exposure. These metabolic changes indicated that the toxic effects of PCB95 may be associated with the interaction of PCB95 with the nervous and immune systems, thus resulting in disruption of energy metabolism and liver function.},

Recently, with the development of rapid scanning high-resolution high accuracy mass spectrometers and the desire for high throughput screening, minimal or no chromatographic separation has become increasingly popular. When analyzing complex cellular extracts, however, the lack of chromatographic separation could potentially result in misannotation of structurally related metabolites. Here, we show that, even using electrospray ionization, a soft ionization method, in-source fragmentation generates unwanted byproducts of identical mass to common metabolites. For example, nucleotide-triphosphates generate nucleotide-diphosphates, and hexose-phosphates generate triose-phosphates. We evaluated yeast intracellular metabolite extracts and found more than 20 cases of in-source fragments that mimic common metabolites. Accordingly, chromatographic separation is required for accurate quantitation of many common cellular metabolites.},

In order to clarify the biochemical mechanisms of drug resistance during anticancer drug treatment, we studied the metabolomics of MCF-7/S and MCF-7/Adr cell lines, the COC1 and COC1/DDP cell lines, including the metabolic pathways of multidrug-resistant tumor cells and the changes of endogenous substances in cells. The intracellular metabolites were profiled using ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS). In this study, 24 biomarkers in MCF-7/Adr cells and 15 biomarkers in COC1/DDP cells that are involved in some important metabolic pathways were putatively identified. Several metabolic pathways are changed in tumor cells showing drug resistance, such as protein synthesis pathways, cysteine synthesis, the glutamine metabolic pathway, and the ammonia cycle; the first of these are involved in the synthesis of some important proteins including membrane proteins, multidrug resistance-associated proteins, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Proteins related to drug resistance were overexpressed in multidrug-resistant tumor cells. These proteins depended on energy and play important roles in the emergence of drug resistance. The changes in glutathione and cysteine metabolic pathways showed that the cells can activate related metabolic pathways and reduce the cell apoptosis when they encounter oxidative damage. These findings indicate that drug resistance is likely associated with increased P-gp synthesis and reduced apoptosis of tumor cells.Graphical AbstractDrug resistance was charactered in the changing of genomics and proteomics.

Upstream biological disruptions result in a series of metabolomic changes and, as such, the metabolome holds a wealth of information that is thought to be most predictive of phenotype. Uncovering this knowledge is a work in progress. The field of metabolomics is still maturing; the community has leveraged proteomics experience when applicable and developed a range of sample preparation and instrument methodology along with myriad data processing and analysis approaches. Research focuses have now shifted toward a fundamental understanding of the biology responsible for metabolomic changes. There are several types of metabolomics experiments including both targeted and untargeted analyses. While untargeted, hypothesis generating workflows exhibit many valuable attributes, challenges inherent to the approach remain. This Critical Insight comments on these challenges, focusing on the identification process of LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics studies—specifically in mammalian systems. Biological interpretation of metabolomics data hinges on the ability to accurately identify metabolites. The range of confidence associated with identifications that is often overlooked is reviewed, and opportunities for advancing the metabolomics field are described.Graphical Abstractᅟ},

	abstract = {Septic shock is the most severe form of sepsis, which is still one of the leading causes of death in the intensive care unit (ICU). Even though early prognosis and diagnosis are known to be indispensable for reaching an optimistic outcome, pathogenic complexities and the lack of specific treatment make it difficult to predict the outcome individually. In the present study, serum samples from surviving and non-surviving septic shock patients were drawn before clinical intervention at admission. Metabolic profiles of all the samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. One thousand four hundred nineteen peaks in positive mode and 1878 peaks in negative mode were retained with their relative standard deviation (RSD) below 30 \%, in which 187 metabolites were initially identified by retention time and database in the light of the exact molecular mass. Differences between samples from the survivors and the non-survivors were investigated using multivariate and univariate analysis. Finally, 43 significantly varied metabolites were found in the comparison between survivors and non-survivors. Concretely, metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, amino acids, and several energy metabolism-related metabolites were up-regulated in the non-survivors, whereas those in the urea cycle and fatty acids were generally down-regulated. Metabolites such as lysine, alanine, and methionine did not present significant changes in the comparison. Six metabolites were further defined as primary discriminators differentiating the survivors from the non-survivors at the early stage of septic shock. Our findings reveal that LC-MS-based metabolomics is a useful tool for studying septic shock.Graphical abstractᅟ},

Understanding the interaction between nanopesticides and edible plants is crucial in evaluating the potential impact of nanotechnology on the environment and agriculture. Here we exposed lettuce plants to Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides (1050–2100 mg/L) through foliar spray for one month. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) results indicate that 97–99\% (1353–2501 mg/kg) of copper was sequestered in the leaves and only a small percentage (1–3\%) (17.5–56.9 mg/kg) was translocated to root tissues through phloem loading. Gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) based metabolomics combined with partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) multivariate analysis revealed that Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides altered metabolite levels of lettuce leaves. Tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle and a number of amino acid-related biological pathways were disturbed. Some antioxidant levels (cis-caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid, dehydroascorbic acid) were significantly decreased compared to the control, indicating that oxidative stress and a defense response occurred. Nicotianamine, a copper chelator, increased by 12–27 fold compared to the control, which may represent a detoxification mechanism. The up-regulation of polyamines (spermidine and putrescine) and potassium may mitigate oxidative stress and enhance tolerance.

	abstract = {Background: The gut metabolome may be associated with the incidence and progression of numerous diseases. The composition of the gut metabolome can be captured by measuring metabolite levels in the feces. However, there are little data describing the effect of fecal sample collection methods on metabolomic measures.
Methods: We collected fecal samples from 18 volunteers using four methods: no solution, 95\% ethanol, fecal occult blood test (FOBT) cards, and fecal immunochemical test (FIT). One set of samples was frozen after collection (day 0), and for 95\% ethanol, FOBT, and FIT, a second set was frozen after 96 hours at room temperature. We evaluated (i) technical reproducibility within sample replicates, (ii) stability after 96 hours at room temperature for 95\% ethanol, FOBT, and FIT, and (iii) concordance of metabolite measures with the putative “gold standard,” day 0 samples without solution.
Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) estimating technical reproducibility were high for replicate samples for each collection method. ICCs estimating stability at room temperature were high for 95\% ethanol and FOBT (median ICC {\textgreater} 0.87) but not FIT (median ICC = 0.52). Similarly, Spearman correlation coefficients (rs) estimating metabolite concordance with the “gold standard” were higher for 95\% ethanol (median rs = 0.82) and FOBT (median rs = 0.70) than for FIT (median rs = 0.40).
Conclusions: Metabolomic measurements appear reproducible and stable in fecal samples collected with 95\% ethanol or FOBT. Concordance with the “gold standard” is highest with 95\% ethanol and acceptable with FOBT.
Impact: Future epidemiologic studies should collect feces using 95\% ethanol or FOBT if interested in studying fecal metabolomics. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(11); 1483–90. ©2016 AACR.},

However, little is known about the effects of DMY in the context of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Male Sprague-Dawley(SD) rats were fed a HFD(60\% fat) supplemented with DMY for 8 weeks. The administration of DMY to the rats with HFD-induced insulin resistance reduces hyperglycemia, plasma levels of insulin, and steatosis in the liver. Furthermore, DMY treatment modulated 24 metabolic pathways, including glucose metabolism, the TCA cycle. DMY significantly enhanced glucose uptake and improved the translocation of glucose transporter 1. The specificity of DMY promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In addition, the exposure of HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations impaired the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt2 Ser474 and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) Ser612, increased GSK-3β phosphorylation, and upregulated G6Pase and PEPCK expression. Collectively, DMY improved glucose-related metabolism while reducing lipid levels in the HFD-fed rats. These data suggest that DMY might be a useful drug for use in type 2 diabetes insulin resistance therapy and for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.},

	abstract = {Brain is still an organ with a composition to be discovered but beyond that, mental disorders and especially all diseases that curse with dementia are devastating for the patient, the family and the society. Metabolomics can offer an alternative tool for unveiling new insights in the discovery of new treatments and biomarkers of mental disorders. Until now, most of metabolomic studies have been based on biofluids: serum/plasma or urine, because brain tissue accessibility is limited to animal models or post mortem studies, but even so it is crucial for understanding the pathological processes. Metabolomics studies of brain tissue imply several challenges due to sample extraction, along with brain heterogeneity, sample storage, and sample treatment for a wide coverage of metabolites with a wide range of concentrations of many lipophilic and some polar compounds. In this review, the current analytical practices for target and non-targeted metabolomics are described and discussed with emphasis on critical aspects: sample treatment (quenching, homogenization, filtration, centrifugation and extraction), analytical methods, as well as findings considering the used strategies. Besides that, the altered analytes in the different brain regions have been associated with their corresponding pathways to obtain a global overview of their dysregulation, trying to establish the link between altered biological pathways and pathophysiological conditions.},

	abstract = {Silkworm (Bombyx mori) is a very useful target insect for evaluation of endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) due to mature breeding techniques, complete endocrine system and broad basic knowledge on developmental biology. Comparative metabolomics of silkworms with and without EDC exposure offers another dimension of studying EDCs. In this work, we report a workflow on metabolomic profiling of silkworm hemolymph based on high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and demonstrate its application in studying the metabolic changes associated with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposure in silkworm. Hemolymph samples were taken from mature silkworms after growing on diet that contained DDT at four different concentrations (1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 ppm) as well as on diet without DDT as controls. They were subjected to differential 12C-/13C-dansyl labeling of the amine/phenol submetabolome, LC-UV quantification of the total amount of labeled metabolites for sample normalization, and LC-MS detection and relative quantification of individual metabolites in comparative samples. The total concentration of labeled metabolites did not show any significant change between four DDT-treatment groups and one control group. Multivariate statistical analysis of the metabolome data set showed that there was a distinct metabolomic separation between the five groups. Out of the 2044 detected peak pairs, 338 and 1471 metabolites have been putatively identified against the HMDB database and the EML library, respectively. 65 metabolites were identified by the dansyl library searching based on the accurate mass and retention time. Among the 65 identified metabolites, 33 positive metabolites had changes of greater than 1.20-fold or less than 0.83-fold in one or more groups with p-value of smaller than 0.05. Several useful biomarkers including serine, methionine, tryptophan, asymmetric dimethylarginine, N-Methyl-D-aspartic and tyrosine were identified. The changes of these biomarkers were likely due to the disruption of the endocrine system of silkworm by DDT. This work illustrates that the method of CIL LC-MS is useful to generate quantitative submetabolome profiles from a small volume of silkworm hemolymph with much higher coverage than conventional LC-MS methods, thereby facilitating the discovery of potential metabolite biomarkers related to EDC or other chemical exposure.},

	abstract = {Cyclophosphamide (CY) is a commonly-used nitrogen mustard alkylating agent, but its clinical application is severely limited by its cardiotoxicity. Since the development of metabolomics, the change of metabolite profiles caused by cyclophosphamide has been studied by metabolomics and has gained much attention. In this study, we analyzed rat plasma samples collected one, three and five days after cyclophosphamide administration using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS). Multiple statistical analyses, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares ⿿ discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were used to examine metabolite profile changes in plasma samples in order to screen for potential cardiotoxicity biomarkers and metabolic pathways. Levels of a dozen of metabolites changed significantly in plasma from the CY-treated group after one, three, and five days compared with the control group treated with normal saline (NS). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis suggested that the total 16 metabolites play important roles in different times of CY-induced cardiotoxicity respectively. Our results suggest that these metabolites in linoleic acid metabolism and glycerol phospholipid metabolism may be related to CY-induced cardiotoxicity. These metabolites could act as sensitive biomarkers for CY-induced cardiotoxicity and be useful for investigating toxic mechanisms. They may also lay a foundation for clinical use of cyclophosphamide.},

Accordingly, a metabolomics study based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to elucidate the molecular developmental toxicology of H-BPA using the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigmas) embryo model. Here, we revealed decreased synthesis of nucleosides, amino acids and lipids, and disruptions in the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle, glycolysis and lipid metabolism, thus inhibiting the developmental processes of embryos exposed to H-BPA. Unexpectedly, we observed enhanced neural activity accompanied by lactate accumulation and accelerated heart rates due to an increase in dopamine pathway and a decrease in inhibitory neurotransmitters following H-BPA exposure. Notably, disorders of the neural system, and disruptions in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, nucleoside metabolism, lipid metabolism, glutamate and aspartate metabolism induced by H-BPA exposure were heritable. Furthermore, lactate and dopa were identified as potential biomarkers of the developmental toxicity of H-BPA and related genetic effects. This study has demonstrated that the metabolomics approach is a useful tool for obtaining comprehensive and novel insights into the molecular developmental toxicity of environmental pollutants.},

Based on the pure spectrum, the corresponding component can be eventually identified and quantified. Deconvolution is challenging due to the existence of co-elution. In this review, we focus on progress that has been made in the development of deconvolution algorithms and provide thoughts on future developments that will expand the application of GC-MS in metabolomics.},

A typical microarray experiment can produce millions of data points, raising serious problems of data reduction, and simultaneous inference. We consider one such experiment in which oligonucleotide arrays were employed to assess the genetic effects of ionizing radiation on seven thousand human genes. A simple nonparametric empirical Bayes model is introduced, which is used to guide the efficient reduction of the data to a single summary statistic per gene, and also to make simultaneous inferences concerning which genes were affected by the radiation. Although our focus is on one specific experiment, the proposed methods can be applied quite generally. The empirical Bayes inferences are closely related to the frequentist false discovery rate (FDR) criterion.},

Inferior outcomes have been attributed to donor warm ischaemic damage in these DCD organs. Here we sought to profile the metabolic mechanisms underpinning donor warm ischaemia. Non-targeted Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry metabolomics was applied to biopsies of liver grafts from donors after brain death (DBD; n = 27) and DCD (n = 10), both during static cold storage (T1) as well as post-reperfusion (T2). Furthermore 6 biopsies from DBD donors prior to the organ donation (T0) were also profiled. Considering DBD and DCD together, significant metabolic differences were discovered between T1 and T2 (688 peaks) that were primarily related to amino acid metabolism, meanwhile T0 biopsies grouped together with T2, denoting the distinctively different metabolic activity of the perfused state. Major metabolic differences were discovered between DCD and DBD during cold-phase (T1) primarily related to glucose, tryptophan and kynurenine metabolism, and in the post-reperfusion phase (T2) related to amino acid and glutathione metabolism. We propose tryptophan/kynurenine and S-adenosylmethionine as possible biomarkers for the previously established higher graft failure of DCD livers, and conclude that the associated pathways should be targeted in more exhaustive and quantitative investigations.},

The idea of applying permutation test ideas to PA leads to a quasi-inferential, non-parametric version of PA which accounts not only for finite-sample bias but sampling variability as well. We give evidence, however, that quasi-inferential PA based on normal random variates (as opposed to data permutations) is surprisingly independent of distributional assumptions, and enjoys therefore certain non- parametric properties as well. This is a justification for providing tables for quasi-inferential PA. Based on permutation theory, we compare PA of principal components with PA of principal factor analysis and show that PA of principal factors may tend to select too many factors. We also apply parallel analysis to so-called resistant correlations and give evidence that this yields a slightly more conservative factor selection method. Finally, we apply PA to loadings and show how this provides benchmark values for loadings which are sensitive to the number of variables, number of subjects, and order of factors. These values therefore improve on conventional fixed thresholds such as 0.5 or 0.8 which are used irrespective of the size of the data},

Spreng which play a role to inhibit viability of breast cancer MCF-7 cells using HPLC-based metabolomics approach. Five fractions of the plant extract were observed including ethanol, hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water fraction. There were 45 HPLC chromatograms resulted from 5 fractions with 3 replications and 3 wavelengths detection. The chromatograms were compared to the data of IC50 from MTT assay of each fraction against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells using metabolomics. The OPLS analysis result promptly pointed towards a chloroform fraction at retention time of 40.16–41.28 min that has the greatest contribution to the cytotoxic activity. The data of mass spectra indicated that an abietane diterpene namely 7-acetoxy-6-hydroxyroyleanone was the main compound that contributed to the cytotoxic activity. This metabolomics application method can be used as a quick preliminary guideline to uncover the most dominant compound related to the bioactivity.},

A comprehensive metabolomics analysis of tobacco middle leaves at 5 different developmental stages was implemented through multi-platform methods based on liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. In total, 412 metabolites were identified, including pigments, sterols, lipids, amino acids, polyamines, sugars and secondary metabolites. Dramatic metabolic changes were observed. Firstly, membrane degradation and chlorophyll down-regulation occurred after the 50\% flower bud stage. Levels of major membrane lipids decreased, including those of the glycolipids in chloroplast thylakoids and phospholipids in membrane envelopes. Clear decreases in free sterols and acylated sterol glucosides were detected along with the accumulation of sterol esters. The accumulation of alkaloids was found. The amino acid levels were significantly decreased, particularly those of N-rich amino acids (glutamine and asparagine), thus reflecting N translocation. Subsequently, the antioxidant system was activated. Sugar alcohols and polyphenols accumulated when the lower leaves turned yellow. These results comprehensively revealed the metabolic changes that occur during tobacco leaf development and senescence under natural conditions.},

We used a single bovine embryo culture step (24 h) supporting improved birth rates under chemically defined conditions (CDC) to investigate biomarker detection of embryonic sex in contrast to classical BSA-containing medium. In vitro matured slaughterhouse oocytes were fertilized in vitro with a single bull. Embryos were initially cultured in synthetic oviduct fluid with BSA. On day-6, morulae were cultured individually in droplets with (BSA) or without protein (CDC). On day-7, expanded blastocysts were sexed (amelogenin gene amplification) and CM was stored at −145 °C until metabolomic analysis by UHPLC-TOF MS. N = 10 embryos per group (i.e. male-protein; female-protein; male-non-protein; female-non-protein) were produced. Statistical analysis revealed N = 6 metabolites with different concentrations in CM, N = 5 in male embryos (methionine, tryptophan, N-stearoyl-valine, biotin and pipecolic acid), N = 1 in female embryos (threonine) (P \&lt; 0.05 in BSA; P \&lt; 10−7 in CDC). Only the clear threshold between males and females in CDC allowed correct classification of 100\% males and 91\% females within 5 out of 6 biomarkers (one female outlier showing the male biomarker profile). The use of CDC represents a critical aspect in the efficient detection of embryonic sex biomarkers by metabolomics.},

	abstract = {Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) produces large and complex datasets characterized by co-eluted compounds and at trace levels, and with a distinct compound ion-redundancy as a result of the high fragmentation by the electron impact ionization. Compounds in GC–MS can be resolved by taking advantage of the multivariate nature of GC–MS data by applying multivariate resolution methods. However, multivariate methods have to be applied in small regions of the chromatogram, and therefore chromatograms are segmented prior to the application of the algorithms. The automation of this segmentation process is a challenging task as it implies separating between informative data and noise from the chromatogram. This study demonstrates the capabilities of independent component analysis–orthogonal signal deconvolution (ICA–OSD) and multivariate curve resolution–alternating least squares (MCR–ALS) with an overlapping moving window implementation to avoid the typical hard chromatographic segmentation. Also, after being resolved, compounds are aligned across samples by an automated alignment algorithm. We evaluated the proposed methods through a quantitative analysis of GC–qTOF MS data from 25 serum samples. The quantitative performance of both moving window ICA–OSD and MCR–ALS-based implementations was compared with the quantification of 33 compounds by the XCMS package. Results shown that most of the R2 coefficients of determination exhibited a high correlation (R2 \&gt; 0.90) in both ICA–OSD and MCR–ALS moving window-based approaches.},

Failure to account for such variation may lead to misclassification and accumulation of missing data in case of less concentrated urine specimens. Here, different pre- and post-acquisition methods of normalization were compared systematically for their ability to recover features from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolite fingerprints of urine that allow distinction between patients with chronic kidney disease and healthy controls. Methods of normalization that were employed prior to analysis included dilution of urine specimens to either a fixed creatinine concentration or osmolality value. Post-acquisition normalization methods applied to chromatograms of 1:4 diluted urine specimens comprised normalization to creatinine, osmolality, and sum of all integrals. Dilution of urine specimens to a fixed creatinine concentration resulted not only in the least number of missing values, but it was also the only method allowing the unambiguous classification of urine specimens from healthy and diseased individuals. The robustness of classification could be confirmed for two independent patient cohorts of chronic kidney disease patients and yielded a shared set of 49 discriminant metabolite features.Graphical AbstractDilution to a uniform creatinine concentration across urine specimens yields more comparable urinary metabolite fingerprints},

However, GC×GC/TOF-MS data processing is currently limited to vendor software and typically requires several preprocessing steps. In this work, we implement a web-based platform, which we call GC2MS, to facilitate the application of recent advances in GC×GC/TOF-MS, especially for metabolomics studies. The core processing workflow of GC2MS consists of blob/peak detection, baseline correction, and blob alignment. GC2MS treats GC×GC/TOF-MS data as pictures and clusters the pixels as blobs according to the brightness of each pixel to generate a blob table. GC2MS then aligns the blobs of two GC×GC/TOF-MS data sets according to their distance and similarity. The blob distance and similarity are the Euclidean distance of the first and second retention times of two blobs and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient of the two mass spectra, respectively. GC2MS also directly corrects the raw data baseline. The analytical performance of GC2MS was evaluated using GC×GC/TOF-MS data sets of Angelica sinensis compounds acquired under different experimental conditions and of human plasma samples. The results show that GC2MS is an easy-to-use tool for detecting peaks and correcting baselines, and GC2MS is able to align GC×GC/TOF-MS data sets acquired under different experimental conditions. GC2MS is freely accessible at http://gc2ms.web.cmdm.tw.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

One multiple hypothesis testing error measure is the false discovery rate (FDR), which is loosely defined to be the expected proportion of false positives among all significant hypotheses. The FDR is especially appropriate for exploratory analyses in which one is interested in finding several significant results among many tests. In this work, we introduce a modified version of the FDR called the "positive false discoveryrate" (pFDR). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the pFDR and investigate its statistical properties. When assuming the test statistics follow a mixture distribution, we show that the pFDR can be written as a Bayesian posterior probability and can be connected to classification theory. These properties remain asymptotically true under fairly general conditions, even under certain forms of dependence. Also, a new quantity called the "qqq-value" is introduced and investigated, which is a natural "Bayesian posterior p-value," or rather the pFDR analogue of the p-value.},

	abstract = {Enzymes regulate biological processes through the conversion of specific substrates to products. Therefore, of fundamental interest for every enzyme is the elucidation of its natural substrates. Here, we describe a general strategy for identifying endogenous substrates of enzymes by untargeted liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry (LC−MS) analysis of tissue metabolomes from wild-type and enzyme-inactivated organisms. We use this method to discover several brain lipids regulated by the mammalian enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in vivo, including known signaling molecules (e.g., the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide) and a novel family of nervous system-enriched natural products, the taurine-conjugated fatty acids. Remarkably, the relative hydrolytic activity that FAAH exhibited for lipid metabolites in vitro was not predictive of the identity of specific FAAH substrates in vivo. Thus, global metabolite profiling establishes unanticipated connections between the proteome and metabolome that enable assignment of an enzyme's unique biochemical functions in vivo.},

So far, ≥16 normalization methods have been widely applied for processing the LC/MS based metabolomics data. However, the performance and the sample size dependence of those methods have not yet been exhaustively compared and no online tool for comparatively and comprehensively evaluating the performance of all 16 normalization methods has been provided. In this study, a comprehensive comparison on these methods was conducted. As a result, 16 methods were categorized into three groups based on their normalization performances across various sample sizes. The VSN, the Log Transformation and the PQN were identified as methods of the best normalization performance, while the Contrast consistently underperformed across all sub-datasets of different benchmark data. Moreover, an interactive web tool comprehensively evaluating the performance of 16 methods specifically for normalizing LC/MS based metabolomics data was constructed and hosted at http://server.idrb.cqu.edu.cn/MetaPre/. In summary, this study could serve as a useful guidance to the selection of suitable normalization methods in analyzing the LC/MS based metabolomics data.},

	abstract = {Custom software entitled Plant Metabolite Annotation Toolbox (PlantMAT) has been developed to address the number one grand challenge in metabolomics, which is the large-scale and confident identification of metabolites. PlantMAT uses informed phytochemical knowledge for the prediction of plant natural products such as saponins and glycosylated flavonoids through combinatorial enumeration of aglycone, glycosyl, and acyl subunits. Many of the predicted structures have yet to be characterized and are absent from traditional chemical databases, but have a higher probability of being present in planta. PlantMAT allows users to operate an automated and streamlined workflow for metabolite annotation from a user-friendly interface within Microsoft Excel, a familiar, easily accessed program for chemists and biologists. The usefulness of PlantMAT is exemplified using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–ESI-QTOF-MS/MS) metabolite profiling data of saponins and glycosylated flavonoids from the model legume Medicago truncatula. The results demonstrate PlantMAT substantially increases the chemical/metabolic space of traditional chemical databases. Ten of the PlantMAT-predicted identifications were validated and confirmed through the isolation of the compounds using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry–solid-phase extraction (UHPLC–MS–SPE) followed by de novo structural elucidation using 1D/2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). It is further demonstrated that PlantMAT enables the dereplication of previously identified metabolites and is also a powerful tool for the discovery of structurally novel metabolites.},

	abstract = {Modern separation methods in conjunction with high-resolution accurate mass (HRAM) spectrometry can provide an enormous number of features characterized by exact mass and chromatographic behavior. Higher mass resolving power usually requires longer scanning times, and thus fewer data points are acquired across the target peak. This could cause difficulties for quantification, feature detection and deconvolution. The aim of this work was to describe the influence of mass spectrometry resolving power on profiling metabolomics experiments. From metabolic databases (HMDB, LipidMaps, KEGG), a list of compounds (41 474) was compiled and potential adducts and isotopes were calculated (622 110 features). The number of distinguishable masses was calculated for up to 3840k resolution. To evaluate these models, human plasma samples were analyzed by LC-HRMS on an Orbitrap Elite hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA) at resolving power settings of 15k (7.8 Hz) up to a maximum of 480k (1.2 Hz). Software XCMS 1.44, MZmine 2.13.1, and Compound Discoverer 2.0.0.303 were used for evaluation. In plasma samples, the number of detected features increased sharply up to 60k in both positive and negative mode. However, beyond these values, it either flattened out or decreased owing to technical limitations. In conclusion, the most effective mass resolving powers for profiling analyses of metabolite rich biofluids on the Orbitrap Elite were around 60 000–120 000 fwhm to retrieve the highest amount of information. The region between 400–800 m/z was influenced the most by resolution.},

	abstract = {Secondary metabolite diversity is considered an important fitness determinant for plants’ biotic and abiotic interactions in nature. This diversity can be examined in two dimensions. The first one considers metabolite diversity across plant species. A second way of looking at this diversity is by considering the tissue-specific localization of pathways underlying secondary metabolism within a plant. Although these cross-tissue metabolite variations are increasingly regarded as important readouts of tissue-level gene function and regulatory processes, they have rarely been comprehensively explored by nontargeted metabolomics. As such, important questions have remained superficially addressed. For instance, which tissues exhibit prevalent signatures of metabolic specialization? Reciprocally, which metabolites contribute most to this tissue specialization in contrast to those metabolites exhibiting housekeeping characteristics? Here, we explore tissue-level metabolic specialization in Nicotiana attenuata, an ecological model with rich secondary metabolism, by combining tissue-wide nontargeted mass spectral data acquisition, information theory analysis, and tandem MS (MS/MS) molecular networks. This analysis was conducted for two different methanolic extracts of 14 tissues and deconvoluted 895 nonredundant MS/MS spectra. Using information theory analysis, anthers were found to harbor the most specialized metabolome, and most unique metabolites of anthers and other tissues were annotated through MS/MS molecular networks. Tissue–metabolite association maps were used to predict tissue-specific gene functions. Predictions for the function of two UDP-glycosyltransferases in flavonoid metabolism were confirmed by virus-induced gene silencing. The present workflow allows biologists to amortize the vast amount of data produced by modern MS instrumentation in their quest to understand gene function.},

	abstract = {Untargeted metabolomics, measurement of large numbers of metabolites irrespective of their chemical or biologic characteristics, has proven useful for identifying novel biomarkers of health and disease. Of particular importance is the analysis of networks of metabolites, as opposed to the level of an individual metabolite. The aim of this study is to achieve causal inference among serum metabolites in an observational setting. A metabolomics causal network is identified using the genome granularity directed acyclic graph (GDAG) algorithm where information across the genome in a deeper level of granularity is extracted to create strong instrumental variables and identify causal relationships among metabolites in an upper level of granularity.

Information from 1,034,945 genetic variants distributed across the genome was used to identify a metabolomics causal network among 122 serum metabolites. We introduce individual properties within the network, such as strength of a metabolite. Based on these properties, hypothesized targets for intervention and prediction are identified. Four nodes corresponding to the metabolites leucine, arichidonoyl-glycerophosphocholine, N-acyelyalanine, and glutarylcarnitine had high impact on the entire network by virtue of having multiple arrows pointing out, which propagated long distances. Five modules, largely corresponding to functional metabolite categories (e.g. amino acids), were identified over the network and module boundaries were determined using directionality and causal effect sizes. Two families, each consists of a triangular motif identified in the network had essential roles in the network by virtue of influencing a large number of other nodes. We discuss causal effect measurement while confounders and mediators are identified graphically.},

Metabolomics based on ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was untilized to identify and analyze obesity related metabolites in rat urine samples. Multivariate analyses were applied to differentiate metabolite patterns between HFD group and normal group. The study successfully identified 20 altered urine metabolites that correlated with obesity. These metabolites are mainly involved in tryptophan metabolism, phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, gut microbiota metabolism and insulin resistance related metabolism. They could serve as potential biomarkers to diagnose the development of obesity.},

To evaluate the algorithms, we compared the annotation of CAMERA against a manually defined annotation for a mixture of known compounds spiked into a complex matrix at different concentrations. CAMERA successfully extracted accurate masses for 89.7\% and 90.3\% of the annotatable compounds in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, we present a novel annotation approach that combines spectral information of data acquired in opposite ion modes to further improve the annotation rate. We demonstrate the utility of CAMERA in two different, easily adoptable plant metabolomics experiments, where the application of CAMERA drastically reduced the amount of manual analysis.},

	abstract = {IntroductionLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a commonly used technique in untargeted metabolomics owing to broad coverage of metabolites, high sensitivity and simple sample preparation. However, data generated from multiple batches are affected by measurement errors inherent to alterations in signal intensity, drift in mass accuracy and retention times between samples both within and between batches. These measurement errors reduce repeatability and reproducibility and may thus decrease the power to detect biological responses and obscure interpretation.ObjectiveOur aim was to develop procedures to address and correct for within- and between-batch variability in processing multiple-batch untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data to increase their quality.MethodsAlgorithms were developed for: (i) alignment and merging of features that are systematically misaligned between batches, through aggregating feature presence/missingness on batch level and combining similar features orthogonally present between batches; and (ii) within-batch drift correction using a cluster-based approach that allows multiple drift patterns within batch. Furthermore, a heuristic criterion was developed for the feature-wise choice of reference-based or population-based between-batch normalisation.ResultsIn authentic data, between-batch alignment resulted in picking 15 \% more features and deconvoluting 15 \% of features previously erroneously aligned. Within-batch correction provided a decrease in median quality control feature coefficient of variation from 20.5 to 15.1 \%. Algorithms are open source and available as an R package (‘batchCorr’).ConclusionsThe developed procedures provide unbiased measures of improved data quality, with implications for improved data analysis. Although developed for LC-MS based metabolomics, these methods are generic and can be applied to other data suffering from similar limitations.},

A total of 158 individual HOCs from 32 different structural classes were detected in the blubber of 4 adult male T. truncatus. Nearly 90\% of the detected compounds are not routinely monitored in the environment. DDT-related and mirex/dechlorane-related compounds were the most abundant classes of anthropogenic origin. Methoxy-brominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-BDEs) and chlorinated methyl- and dimethyl bipyrroles (MBPs and DMBPs) were the most abundant natural products. Reported for the first time in southwestern Atlantic cetaceans and in contrast to North American marine mammals, chlorinated MBPs and DMBPs were more abundant than their brominated and/or mixed halogenated counterparts. HOC profiles in coastal T. truncatus from Brazil and California revealed a distinct difference, with a higher abundance of MeO-BDEs, mirex/dechloranes and chlorinated bipyrroles in the Brazilian dolphins. Thirty-six percent of the detected HOCs had an unknown structure. These results suggest broad geographical differences in the patterns of bioaccumulative chemicals found in the marine environment and indicate the need to develop more complete catalogs of HOCs from various marine environments.},

Because of dilution, measured concentrations of dispersed oil in the sea are sub-parts-per-million within a day of dispersal, and at such concentrations the rate of biodegradation of detectable oil hydrocarbons has an apparent half-life of 7–14 days. This can be contrasted with the rate of degradation at the higher concentrations found in oil slicks or when stranded on a shoreline; there the apparent half-life varies from many months to many years.},

Although the burden of IC on the American public is immense in both human and financial terms, there is no clear diagnostic test for IC, but rather it is a disease of exclusion. Very little is known about the clinically useful urinary biomarkers of IC, which are desperately needed. Untargeted comprehensive metabolomic profiling was performed using gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry to compare urine specimens of IC patients or health donors. The study profiled 200 known and 290 unknown metabolites. The majority of the thirty significantly changed metabolites before false discovery rate correction were unknown compounds. Partial least square discriminant analysis clearly separated IC patients from controls. The high number of unknown compounds hinders useful biological interpretation of such predictive models. Given that urine analyses have great potential to be adapted in clinical practice, research has to be focused on the identification of unknown compounds to uncover important clues about underlying disease mechanisms.},

This limits our detailed understanding of extraction parameters such as recovery and matrix effects and prevents side-by-side comparison of different sample preparation strategies. To address this gap in knowledge, seven solvent-based and solid-phase extraction methods were systematically evaluated using standard analytes spiked into both buffer and human plasma. We compared recovery, coverage, repeatability, matrix effects, selectivity and orthogonality of all methods tested for non-lipid metabolome in combination with reversed-phased and mixed-mode liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS). Our results confirmed wide selectivity and excellent precision of solvent precipitations, but revealed their high susceptibility to matrix effects. The use of all seven methods showed high overlap and redundancy which resulted in metabolite coverage increases of 34–80\% depending on LC-MS method employed as compared to the best single extraction protocol (methanol/ethanol precipitation) despite 7x increase in MS analysis time and sample consumption. The most orthogonal methods to methanol-based precipitation were ion-exchange solid-phase extraction and liquid-liquid extraction using methyl-tertbutyl ether. Our results help facilitate rational design and selection of sample preparation methods and internal standards for global metabolomics.},

	abstract = {“Sola dosis facit venenum.” These words of Paracelsus, “the dose makes the poison”, can lead to a cavalier attitude concerning potential toxicities of the vast array of low abundance environmental chemicals to which humans are exposed. Exposome research teaches that 80–85\% of human disease is linked to environmental exposures. The human exposome is estimated to include {\textgreater}400,000 environmental chemicals, most of which are uncharacterized with regard to human health. In fact, mass spectrometry measures {\textgreater}200,000 m/z features (ions) in microliter volumes derived from human samples; most are unidentified. This crystallizes a grand challenge for chemical research in toxicology: to develop reliable and affordable analytical methods to understand health impacts of the extensive human chemical experience. To this end, there appears to be no choice but to abandon the limitations of measuring one chemical at a time. The present review looks at progress in computational metabolomics to provide probability-based annotation linking ions to known chemicals and serve as a foundation for unambiguous designation of unidentified ions for toxicologic study. We review methods to characterize ions in terms of accurate mass m/z, chromatographic retention time, correlation of adduct, isotopic and fragment forms, association with metabolic pathways and measurement of collision-induced dissociation products, collision cross section, and chirality. Such information can support a largely unambiguous system for documenting unidentified ions in environmental surveillance and human biomonitoring. Assembly of this data would provide a resource to characterize and understand health risks of the array of low-abundance chemicals to which humans are exposed.},

In this paper, we present a publicly available metabolomic ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry spike-in data set for apples. The data set consists of 10 control samples and three spiked sets of the same size, where naturally occurring compounds are added in different concentrations. In this sense, the data set can serve as a test bed to assess the performance of new algorithms and compare them with previously published results. We illustrate some of the possibilities provided by this spike-in data set by comparing the performance of two popular biomarker-selection methods, the univariate t-test and the multivariate variable importance in projection.

An analytical method using solid-phrase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometer (GC–MS/MS) was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of nineteen BrPs in human urine. The method detection limits (MDLs) were below 23 pg mL−1, with recovery ranged from 63\% to 133\% and inter-day repeatability ranged from 3\% to 11\% for the majority of target analytes. This method was applied in a pilot study and 2-Bromophenol (2-BrP), 4-Bromophenol (4-BrP), 2,4-Dibromophenol (2,4-DBP) and 2,4,6-Tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP) as the predominant analytes were detected in human urine samples collected from the general population. Among the four detected analytes, 2-BrP and 4-BrP as the mono-brominated BrP congeners were firstly reported. To our knowledge, it is the first study covering all BrP congeners (from mono-brominated to penta-brominated, totally 19 congeners) in human urine. Therefore, this study is very useful for profiling urinary BrPs and discovering potential relationship between urinary BrPs and human internal exposure to PBDEs. The mechanism of fragmentation pathway of silanized BrPs was firstly illustrated in this study.},

	abstract = {Bromophenols (BrPs), as the metabolites of PBDEs, would be the potential exposure markers for human biomonitoring (HB) of PBDEs in urine. An analytical method using solid-phrase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometer (GC–MS/MS) was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of nineteen BrPs in human urine. The method detection limits (MDLs) were below 23 pg mL−1, with recovery ranged from 63\% to 133\% and inter-day repeatability ranged from 3\% to 11\% for the majority of target analytes. This method was applied in a pilot study and 2-Bromophenol (2-BrP), 4-Bromophenol (4-BrP), 2,4-Dibromophenol (2,4-DBP) and 2,4,6-Tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP) as the predominant analytes were detected in human urine samples collected from the general population. Among the four detected analytes, 2-BrP and 4-BrP as the mono-brominated BrP congeners were firstly reported. To our knowledge, it is the first study covering all BrP congeners (from mono-brominated to penta-brominated, totally 19 congeners) in human urine. Therefore, this study is very useful for profiling urinary BrPs and discovering potential relationship between urinary BrPs and human internal exposure to PBDEs. The mechanism of fragmentation pathway of silanized BrPs was firstly illustrated in this study.},

	abstract = {To explore the cause of species-specific differences and structure-activity relationships in the debromination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in fish, a series of in vitro measurements of hepatic metabolism of PBDE were conducted using crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and catfish (Silurus asotus) and the activities of deiodinases (DIs) in liver microsomes were measured. Debromination was observed in the crucian carp but not in the catfish. No difference was found in the total activities of DIs despite the activity of type 1 DI in crucian carp being twice that of catfish. It is difficult to determine whether the differences in the activities of DIs were responsible for the species-specific differences observed. In crucian carp, penta-brominated diphenyl ether (BDE) congeners exhibited the highest debromination rates, and the transformation rate decreased with an increasing number of substituted bromines. Adjacent bromine substitution in the phenyl ring was a necessary, but insufficient condition for debromination in crucian carp. Doubly flanked bromine was always preferentially removed while single flanked bromine, meta-substituted bromine was debrominated the most, followed by para- and least ortho-bromine. No debromination was observed for single flanked bromine when there was a symmetrical structure with (2, 4, 6) bromine substitutions in one phenyl ring, indicating that this structure can improve resistance to debromination metabolism.

In this study, electrospray ionization coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) was used to characterize the molecular composition of NOM of 20 source waters taken across China for the purpose of determining the major precursors of THMs and HAAs at molecular level. It was found that there is a core of NOM compositions that are ubiquitous in different source waters, which is supposed to be more relevant for NOM quality. Formation potentials (FP) of THMs and HAAs were determined for NOM from different source waters during chlorination. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to link THMFP and HAAFP with the individual molecular composition of NOM. Significant correlation (P {\textless} 0.001) was found between DBPFP and the NOM molecules with a high O/C ratio and low H/C ratio, indicating these molecules could contribute greatly to the formation of THMs and HAAs during chlorination. The link of THMFP and HAAFP with individual NOM molecules may allow us to develop more effective treatment strategies to achieve the drinking water safety objective: effective disinfection of waterborne pathogens while minimizing toxic DBPs.},

	abstract = {Advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) instruments and analytical strategies have brought about great progress in targeted metabolomics analysis. This methodology is now capable of performing precise targeted measurement of dozens or hundreds of metabolites in complex biological samples. Classic targeted quantification assay using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode has been the foundation of high-quality metabolite quantitation. However, utilization of this strategy in biological studies has been limited by its relatively low metabolite coverage and throughput capacity. A number of methods for large-scale targeted metabolomics assay which have been developed overcome these limitations. These strategies have enabled extended metabolite coverage which is defined as targeting of large numbers of metabolites, while maintaining reliable quantification performance. These recently developed techniques thus bridge the gap between traditional targeted metabolite quantification and untargeted metabolomics profiling, and have proven to be powerful tools for metabolomics study. Although the LC-MRM-MS strategy has been used widely in large-scale metabolomics quantification analysis due to its fast scan speed and ideal analytic stability, there are still drawbacks which are due to the low resolution of the triple quadrupole instruments used for MRM assays. New approaches have been developed to expand the options for large-scale targeted metabolomics study, using high-resolution instruments such as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). MRM and PRM-based techniques are now attractive strategies for quantitative metabolomics analysis and high-throughput biomarker discovery. Here we provide an overview of the major developments in LC-MS-based strategies for large-scale targeted metabolomics quantification in biological samples. The advantages of LC-MRM/PRM-MS based analytical strategies which may be used in multiplexed and high throughput quantitation for a wide range of metabolites are highlighted. In particular, PRM and MRM strategies are compared, and we summarize the work flow commonly used for large-scale targeted metabolomics analysis including sample preparation, LC separation and data analysis, as well as recent applications in biological studies.},

	abstract = {Photoreceptor degeneration is characteristic of vision-threatening diseases including age-related macular degeneration. Photoreceptors are metabolically demanding cells in the retina, but specific details about their metabolic behaviours are unresolved. The quantitative metabolomics of retinal degeneration could provide valuable insights and inform future therapies. Here, we determined the metabolomic ‘fingerprint’ of healthy and dystrophic retinas in rat models using optimized metabolite extraction techniques. A number of classes of metabolites were consistently dysregulated during degeneration: vitamin A analogues, fatty acid amides, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, acyl carnitines and several phospholipid species. For the first time, a distinct temporal trend of several important metabolites including DHA (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid), all-trans-retinal and its toxic end-product N-retinyl-N-retinylidene-ethanolamine were observed between healthy and dystrophic retinas. In this study, metabolomics was further used to determine the temporal effects of the therapeutic intervention of grafting stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in dystrophic retinas, which significantly prevented photoreceptor atrophy in our previous studies. The result revealed that lipid levels such as phosphatidylethanolamine in eyes were restored in those animals receiving the RPE grafts. In conclusion, this study provides insight into the metabolomics of retinal degeneration, and further understanding of the efficacy of RPE transplantation.

Mass spectrometry (MS) has been widely used for this purpose. The key challenge here is to be able to capture changes in a reproducible and reliant manner that is representative of the events that take place in vivo. Typically, the analysis is carried out in vitro, by isolating the system and extracting the metabolome. MS-based approaches enable us to capture metabolomic changes with high sensitivity and resolution. When developing the technique for different biological systems, there are similarities in challenges and differences that are specific to the system under investigation. Here, we review some of the challenges in capturing quantitative changes in the metabolome with MS based approaches, primarily in microbial and mammalian systems.

	abstract = {The p-value is the most prominent established metric for statistical significance in non-targeted metabolomics. However, its adequacy has repeatedly been the subject of discussion criticizing its uncertainty and its dependence on sample size and statistical power. These issues compromise non-targeted metabolomics in model systems, where studies typically investigate 5–10 samples per group. In this paper we propose a different approach for assessing the relevance of fold change (FC) data, where the FC is treated as a quantitative value and is validated by uncertainty budgeting. For the purpose of large-scale application in non-targeted metabolomics, we present a simplified approach for uncertainty propagation using experimental standard deviations of metabolite intensities as type A-summarized standard uncertainties. The resulting expanded FC uncertainty can be used to derive a minimum relevant FC as a complementary criterion in metabolomics data evaluation. This concept overcomes the need for a uniform p-value cut-off for all metabolites by considering the experimental uncertainty for each metabolite individually. The proposed procedure is part of analytical method validation, however the concept has not previously been applied to non-targeted metabolomics. A case study on mesenchymal stem cells cultured in normoxia and hypoxia demonstrates the practical value of this approach, in particular for studies with a small sample size. An online two-dimensional LC method coupled to mass spectrometry was crucial in providing both broad metabolome coverage and excellent experimental precision (\&lt;8\% CV for peak areas, on average 0.5\% CV for retention times) that was required for sensitive differential analysis as low as FC 1.1.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with online separation methods is commonly applied for differential and quantitative profiling of biological samples in metabolomic as well as proteomic research. Such approaches are used for systems biology, functional genomics, and biomarker discovery, among others. An ongoing challenge of these molecular profiling approaches, however, is the development of better data processing methods. Here we introduce a new generation of a popular open-source data processing toolbox, MZmine 2.
RESULTS: A key concept of the MZmine 2 software design is the strict separation of core functionality and data processing modules, with emphasis on easy usability and support for high-resolution spectra processing. Data processing modules take advantage of embedded visualization tools, allowing for immediate previews of parameter settings. Newly introduced functionality includes the identification of peaks using online databases, MSn data support, improved isotope pattern support, scatter plot visualization, and a new method for peak list alignment based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. The performance of the RANSAC alignment was evaluated using synthetic datasets as well as actual experimental data, and the results were compared to those obtained using other alignment algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: MZmine 2 is freely available under a GNU GPL license and can be obtained from the project website at: http://mzmine.sourceforge.net/. The current version of MZmine 2 is suitable for processing large batches of data and has been applied to both targeted and non-targeted metabolomic analyses.},

	abstract = {Many metabolomics, and other high-content or high-throughput, experiments are set up such that the primary aim is the discovery of biomarker metabolites that can discriminate, with a certain level of certainty, between nominally matched ‘case’ and ‘control’ samples. However, it is unfortunately very easy to find markers that are apparently persuasive but that are in fact entirely spurious, and there are well-known examples in the proteomics literature. The main types of danger are not entirely independent of each other, but include bias, inadequate sample size (especially relative to the number of metabolite variables and to the required statistical power to prove that a biomarker is discriminant), excessive false discovery rate due to multiple hypothesis testing, inappropriate choice of particular numerical methods, and overfitting (generally caused by the failure to perform adequate validation and cross-validation). Many studies fail to take these into account, and thereby fail to discover anything of true significance (despite their claims). We summarise these problems, and provide pointers to a substantial existing literature that should assist in the improved design and evaluation of metabolomics experiments, thereby allowing robust scientific conclusions to be drawn from the available data. We provide a list of some of the simpler checks that might improve one’s confidence that a candidate biomarker is not simply a statistical artefact, and suggest a series of preferred tests and visualisation tools that can assist readers and authors in assessing papers. These tools can be applied to individual metabolites by using multiple univariate tests performed in parallel across all metabolite peaks. They may also be applied to the validation of multivariate models. We stress in particular that classical p-values such as “p {\textless} 0.05”, that are often used in biomedicine, are far too optimistic when multiple tests are done simultaneously (as in metabolomics). Ultimately it is desirable that all data and metadata are available electronically, as this allows the entire community to assess conclusions drawn from them. These analyses apply to all high-dimensional ‘omics’ datasets.},

In principle, measurement of more than one million chemicals would be possible if algorithms were available to facilitate utilization of the raw mass spectrometry data, especially low-abundance metabolites. Here we describe an automated computational framework to annotate ions for possible chemical identity using a multistage clustering algorithm in which metabolic pathway associations are used along with intensity profiles, retention time characteristics, mass defect, and isotope/adduct patterns. The algorithm uses high-resolution mass spectrometry data for a series of samples with common properties and publicly available chemical, metabolic, and environmental databases to assign confidence levels to annotation results. Evaluation results show that the algorithm achieves an F1-measure of 0.8 for a data set with known targets and is more robust than previously reported results for cases when database size is much greater than the actual number of metabolites. MS/MS evaluation of a set of randomly selected 210 metabolites annotated using xMSannotator in an untargeted metabolomics human data set shows that 80\% of features with high or medium confidence scores have ion dissociation patterns consistent with the xMSannotator annotation. The algorithm has been incorporated into an R package, xMSannotator, which includes utilities for querying local or online databases such as ChemSpider, KEGG, HMDB, T3DB, and LipidMaps.},

	abstract = {The speed and throughput of analytical platforms has been a driving force in recent years in the “omics” technologies and while great strides have been accomplished in both chromatography and mass spectrometry, data analysis times have not benefited at the same pace. Even though personal computers have become more powerful, data transfer times still represent a bottleneck in data processing because of the increasingly complex data files and studies with a greater number of samples. To meet the demand of analyzing hundreds to thousands of samples within a given experiment, we have developed a data streaming platform, XCMS Stream, which capitalizes on the acquisition time to compress and stream recently acquired data files to data processing servers, mimicking just-in-time production strategies from the manufacturing industry. The utility of this XCMS Online-based technology is demonstrated here in the analysis of T cell metabolism and other large-scale metabolomic studies. A large scale example on a 1000 sample data set demonstrated a 10 000-fold time savings, reducing data analysis time from days to minutes. Further, XCMS Stream has the capability to increase the efficiency of downstream biochemical dependent data acquisition (BDDA) analysis by initiating data conversion and data processing on subsets of data acquired, expanding its application beyond data transfer to smart preliminary data decision-making prior to full acquisition.},

The incidence and costs associated with treating osteoporosis cause heavy socio-economic burden. Currently, the diagnosis of osteoporosis mainly depends on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers. However, these indexes are not sensitive and accurate enough to reflect the osteoporosis progression. Metabolomics offers the potential for a holistic approach for clinical diagnoses and treatment, as well as understanding of the pathological mechanism of osteoporosis. In this review, we firstly describe the study subjects of osteoporosis and bio-sample preparation procedures for different analytic purposes, followed by illustrating the biomarkers with potentially predictive, diagnosis and pharmaceutical values when applied in osteoporosis research. Then, we summarize the published metabolic pathways related to osteoporosis. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of chronological data and combination of multi-omics in fully understanding osteoporosis. The application of metabolomics in osteoporosis could provide researchers the opportunity to gain new insight into the metabolic profiling and pathophysiological mechanisms. However, there is still much to be done to validate the potential biomarkers responsible for the progression of osteoporosis and there are still many details needed to be further elucidated.},

Facing the lack of comprehensive studies on urine metabolome stability, the present work performed a follow-up of potential modifications in urinary chemical profile using LC-HRMS on the basis of two parameters: the storage temperature (+4 °C, −20 °C, −80 °C and freeze-dried stored at −80 °C) and the storage duration (5–144 days). Both HILIC and RP chromatographies have been implemented in order to globally monitor the urinary metabolome. Using an original data processing associated to univariate and multivariate data analysis, our study confirms that chemical profiles of urine samples stored at +4 °C are very rapidly modified, as observed for instance for compounds such as:N-acetyl Glycine, Adenosine, 4-Amino benzoic acid, N-Amino diglycine, creatine, glucuronic acid, 3-hydroxy-benzoic acid, pyridoxal, l-pyroglutamic acid, shikimic acid, succinic acid, thymidine, trigonelline and valeryl-carnitine, while it also demonstrates that urine samples stored at −20 °C exhibit a global stability over a long period with no major modifications compared to −80 °C condition. This study is the first to investigate long term stability of urine samples and report potential modifications in the urinary metabolome, using both targeted approach monitoring individually a large number (n \&gt; 200) of urinary metabolites and an untargeted strategy enabling assessing for global impact of storage conditions.},

Since the pregnant women are known to be more susceptible to some chemical exposures than ordinary people, the understanding regarding the health effects of low-level arsenic exposure on pregnant women is critical and remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the urinary metabolic changes of pregnant women exposed to low-dose arsenic, and to identify biomarkers from metabolomics analysis. Urine samples of 246 pregnant women were collected in the first trimester of pregnancy and were divided into three groups based on the tertile distribution of urinary arsenic concentrations which were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Changes in the metabolite profile were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS). Arsenic- related metabolic biomarkers were investigated by comparing the samples of the first and third tertiles of arsenic exposure classifications using a partial least-squares discriminant model (PLS-DA). Nine urine potential biomarkers were putatively identified, including LysoPC (14:0), glutathione, 18-carboxy-dinor-LTE4, 20-COOH-LTE4, cystathionine ketimin, 1-(beta-d-ribofuranosyl)-1,4-dihydronicotinamide, thiocysteine, p-cresol glucuronide and vanillactic acid. The obtained results showed that environmental arsenic exposure, even at low levels, could cause metabolite alterations in pregnant women which might be associated with adverse health outcomes. This is the first report on metabolic changes in pregnant women for arsenic exposure. The findings may be valuable for the arsenic risk assessment for pregnant women.},

We validate this approach by correctly identifying the components in a known mixture and the discriminating components in a spiked mixture.

Recently, with the development of rapid scanning high-resolution high accuracy mass spectrometers and the desire for high throughput screening, minimal or no chromatographic separation has become increasingly popular. When analyzing complex cellular extracts, however, the lack of chromatographic separation could potentially result in misannotation of structurally related metabolites. Here, we show that, even using electrospray ionization, a soft ionization method, in-source fragmentation generates unwanted byproducts of identical mass to common metabolites. For example, nucleotide-triphosphates generate nucleotide-diphosphates, and hexose-phosphates generate triose-phosphates. We evaluated yeast intracellular metabolite extracts and found more than 20 cases of in-source fragments that mimic common metabolites. Accordingly, chromatographic separation is required for accurate quantitation of many common cellular metabolites.},

Facing the lack of comprehensive studies on urine metabolome stability, the present work performed a follow-up of potential modifications in urinary chemical profile using LC-HRMS on the basis of two parameters: the storage temperature (+4 °C, −20 °C, −80 °C and freeze-dried stored at −80 °C) and the storage duration (5–144 days). Both HILIC and RP chromatographies have been implemented in order to globally monitor the urinary metabolome. Using an original data processing associated to univariate and multivariate data analysis, our study confirms that chemical profiles of urine samples stored at +4 °C are very rapidly modified, as observed for instance for compounds such as:N-acetyl Glycine, Adenosine, 4-Amino benzoic acid, N-Amino diglycine, creatine, glucuronic acid, 3-hydroxy-benzoic acid, pyridoxal, l-pyroglutamic acid, shikimic acid, succinic acid, thymidine, trigonelline and valeryl-carnitine, while it also demonstrates that urine samples stored at −20 °C exhibit a global stability over a long period with no major modifications compared to −80 °C condition. This study is the first to investigate long term stability of urine samples and report potential modifications in the urinary metabolome, using both targeted approach monitoring individually a large number (n \&gt; 200) of urinary metabolites and an untargeted strategy enabling assessing for global impact of storage conditions.},

	abstract = {“Sola dosis facit venenum.” These words of Paracelsus, “the dose makes the poison”, can lead to a cavalier attitude concerning potential toxicities of the vast array of low abundance environmental chemicals to which humans are exposed. Exposome research teaches that 80–85\% of human disease is linked to environmental exposures. The human exposome is estimated to include {\textgreater}400,000 environmental chemicals, most of which are uncharacterized with regard to human health. In fact, mass spectrometry measures {\textgreater}200,000 m/z features (ions) in microliter volumes derived from human samples; most are unidentified. This crystallizes a grand challenge for chemical research in toxicology: to develop reliable and affordable analytical methods to understand health impacts of the extensive human chemical experience. To this end, there appears to be no choice but to abandon the limitations of measuring one chemical at a time. The present review looks at progress in computational metabolomics to provide probability-based annotation linking ions to known chemicals and serve as a foundation for unambiguous designation of unidentified ions for toxicologic study. We review methods to characterize ions in terms of accurate mass m/z, chromatographic retention time, correlation of adduct, isotopic and fragment forms, association with metabolic pathways and measurement of collision-induced dissociation products, collision cross section, and chirality. Such information can support a largely unambiguous system for documenting unidentified ions in environmental surveillance and human biomonitoring. Assembly of this data would provide a resource to characterize and understand health risks of the array of low-abundance chemicals to which humans are exposed.},

An intrinsic property of polyhalogenated molecules is a uniquely negative mass defect, which readily distinguishes halogenated from non-halogenated compounds in a complex mass spectrum and can be visualized by constructing a mass defect plot. This study demonstrates the utility of the mass defect plot as a powerful tool to screen gas-chromatography (ultra)high-resolution mass spectrometry data for potentially toxic and bioaccumulative halogenated compounds in a Lake Ontario lake trout, an apex species in the Great Lakes environment. Our results indicate that the sample is contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, terphenyls, diphenylethers, as well as other chlorinated pesticides and flame retardants that are regulated and routinely analyzed by traditional target analyses. However, the mass defect plot also displays peaks which could be traced to the presence of as yet undiscovered contaminants. These include chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as mixed halogenated analogues of the flame retardant Dechlorane 604. The identity of the latter class of compounds is supported by experiments with genuine standards.Open image in new windowFigThe mass defect plot provides an informative picture of the halogenated contaminants in a sample of Lake Ontario lake trout.},

However, these metabolites have to be identified before any biological meaning can be drawn from the data. Metabolite identification is a challenging and low throughput process, therefore becomes the bottleneck of the filed. We report here a novel approach to predict biological activity directly from mass spectrometry data without a priori identification of metabolites. By unifying network analysis and metabolite prediction under the same computational framework, the organization of metabolic networks and pathways helps resolve the ambiguity in metabolite prediction to a large extent. We validated our algorithms on a set of activation experiment of innate immune cells. The predicted activities were confirmed by both gene expression and metabolite identification. This method shall greatly accelerate the application of high throughput metabolomics, as the tedious task of identifying hundreds of metabolites upfront can be shifted to a handful of validation experiments after our computational prediction.},

Here, we present a novel approach to analyze metabolomics data from untargeted, data-independent LC-MS/MS measurements. By integrated analysis of MS1 abundances and MS/MS spectra, the identification of regulated metabolite families is achieved. This approach offers a global view on metabolic regulation in comparative metabolomics. We implemented our approach in the web application “MetFamily”, which is freely available at http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/MetFamily/. MetFamily provides a dynamic link between the patterns based on MS1-signal intensity and the corresponding structural similarity at the MS/MS level. Structurally related metabolites are annotated as metabolite families based on a hierarchical cluster analysis of measured MS/MS spectra. Joint examination with principal component analysis of MS1 patterns, where this annotation is preserved in the loadings, facilitates the interpretation of comparative metabolomics data at the level of metabolite families. As a proof of concept, we identified two trichome-specific metabolite families from wild-type tomato Solanum habrochaites LA1777 in a fully unsupervised manner and validated our findings based on earlier publications and with NMR.},

We identified the metabolites formed in vitro for four alternative plasticizers (acetyltributyl citrate (ATBC), bis(2-propylheptyl) phthalate (DPHP), bis(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHTP), bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA)), and one FR (2,2-bis (chloromethyl)-propane-1,3-diyltetrakis(2-chloroethyl) bisphosphate (V6)). Further, these compounds and their metabolites were investigated by LC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS in urine and finger nails collected from a Norwegian cohort. Primary and secondary ATBC metabolites had detection frequencies (\% DF) in finger nails ranging from 46 to 95\%. V6 was identified for the first time in finger nails, suggesting that this matrix may also indicate past exposure to FRs as well as alternative plasticizers. Two isomeric forms of DEHTP primary metabolite were highly detected in urine (97\% DF) and identified in finger nails, while no DPHP metabolites were detected in vivo. Primary and secondary DEHA metabolites were identified in both matrices, and the relative proportion of the secondary metabolites was higher in urine than in finger nails; the opposite was observed for the primary metabolites. As many of the metabolites present in in vitro extracts were further identified in vivo in urine and finger nail samples, this suggests that in vitro assays can reliably mimic the in vivo processes. Finger nails may be a useful noninvasive matrix for human biomonitoring of specific organic contaminants, but further validation is needed.},

To date, there exists no efficient means of visualization and quantitative assessment of signal drift, correction of drift when present, and automated filtering of unstable spectral features, particularly across thousands of data files in population scale experiments. Herein, we report the development of a set of R-based scripts that allow for pre- and postprocessing of raw LC-MS data. These methods can be integrated with existing data analysis workflows by providing initial preprocessing bulk nonlinear retention time correction at the raw data level. Further, this approach provides postprocessing visualization and quantification of peak alignment accuracy, as well as peak-reliability-based parsing of processed data through hierarchical clustering of signal profiles. In a metabolomics data set derived from ∼3000 human plasma samples, we find that application of our alignment tools resulted in substantial improvement in peak alignment accuracy, automated data filtering, and ultimately statistical power for detection of metabolite correlates of clinical measures. These tools will enable metabolomics studies of population scale cohorts.},

In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of metabolomics (285 samples) and transcriptomics (52 samples) on the potential diagnostic implication and metabolic characteristic description in cervical cancer. Sixty-two metabolites were different between CC and normal controls (NOR), in which 5 metabolites (bilirubin, LysoPC(17:0), n-oleoyl threonine, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid and tetracosahexaenoic acid) were selected as candidate biomarkers for CC. The AUC value, sensitivity (SE), and specificity (SP) of these 5 biomarkers were 0.99, 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. We further analysed the genes in 7 significantly enriched pathways, of which 117 genes, that were expressed differentially, were mainly involved in catalytic activity. Finally, a fully connected network of metabolites and genes in these pathways was built, which can increase the credibility of our selected metabolites. In conclusion, our biomarkers from metabolomics could set a path for CC diagnosis and screening. Our results also showed that variables of both transcriptomics and metabolomics were associated with CC.},

	abstract = {Metabolomic analysis of feces can provide useful insight on the metabolic status, the health/disease state of the human/animal and the symbiosis with the gut microbiome. As a result, recently there is increased interest on the application of holistic analysis of feces for biomarker discovery. For metabolomics applications, the sample preparation process used prior to the analysis of fecal samples is of high importance, as it greatly affects the obtained metabolic profile, especially since feces, as matrix are diversifying in their physicochemical characteristics and molecular content. However there is still little information in the literature and lack of a universal approach on sample treatment for fecal metabolic profiling.
The scope of the present work was to study the conditions for sample preparation of rat feces with the ultimate goal of the acquisition of comprehensive metabolic profiles either untargeted by NMR spectroscopy and GC–MS or targeted by HILIC-MS/MS. A fecal sample pooled from male and female Wistar rats was extracted under various conditions by modifying the pH value, the nature of the organic solvent and the sample weight to solvent volume ratio. It was found that the 1/2 (wf/vs) ratio provided the highest number of metabolites under neutral and basic conditions in both untargeted profiling techniques. Concerning LC–MS profiles, neutral acetonitrile and propanol provided higher signals and wide metabolite coverage, though extraction efficiency is metabolite dependent.},

The efficiency and complementarity of commonly used extraction solvents, namely 1 + 3 (v/v) mixtures of water and selected organic solvents (methanol, acetonitrile or methanol/acetonitrile 1 + 1 (v/v)), with and without the addition of 0.1\% (v/v) formic acid were compared. Four different wheat organs were sampled, extracted and analysed by LC-HRMS. Data evaluation was performed with the in-house-developed MetExtract II software and R. With all tested solvents a total of 871 metabolites were extracted in ear, 785 in stem, 733 in leaf and 517 in root samples, respectively. Between 48\% (stem) and 57\% (ear) of the metabolites detected in a particular organ were found with all extraction mixtures, and 127 of 996 metabolites were consistently shared between all extraction agent/organ combinations. In aqueous methanol, acidification with formic acid led to pronounced pH dependency regarding the precision of metabolite abundance and the number of detectable metabolites, whereas extracts of acetonitrile-containing mixtures were less affected. Moreover, methanol and acetonitrile have been found to be complementary with respect to extraction efficiency. Interestingly, the beneficial properties of both solvents can be combined by the use of a water-methanol-acetonitrile mixture for global metabolite extraction instead of aqueous methanol or aqueous acetonitrile alone.},

One prerequisite is the accurate measurement of the labeling pattern of targeted metabolites. The subsequent estimation of metabolic fluxes following incubation in radiolabelled substrates has been extensively used. Radiolabelling is a sensitive approach and allows determination of total label uptake since the total radiolabel content is easy to detect. However, the incubation of cells, tissues or the whole plant in a stable isotope enriched environment and the use of either mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to determine label incorporation within specific metabolites offers the possibility to readily obtain metabolic information with higher resolution. It additionally also offers an important complement to other post-genomic strategies such as metabolite profiling providing insights into the regulation of the metabolic network and thus allowing a more thorough description of plant cellular function. Thus, although safety concerns mean that stable isotope feeding is generally preferred, the techniques are in truth highly complementary and application of both approaches in tandem currently probably provides the best route towards a comprehensive understanding of plant cellular metabolism.},

Microbial communities in our gut exert a multitude of functions with huge impact on human health and disease. Within the meta-omics discipline, gut microbiome is studied by (meta)genomics, (meta)transcriptomics, (meta)proteomics and metabolomics. The goal of metabolomics research applied to fecal samples is to perform their metabolic profiling, to quantify compounds and classes of interest, to characterize small molecules produced by gut microbes. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry are main technologies that are applied in fecal metabolomics. Metabolomics studies have been increasingly used in gut microbiota related research regarding health and disease with main focus on understanding inflammatory bowel diseases. The elucidated metabolites in this field are summarized in this review. We also addressed the main challenges of metabolomics in current and future gut microbiota research. The first challenge reflects the need of adequate analytical tools and pipelines, including sample handling, selection of appropriate equipment, and statistical evaluation to enable meaningful biological interpretation. The second challenge is related to the choice of the right animal model for studies on gut microbiota. We exemplified this using NMR spectroscopy for the investigation of cross-species comparison of fecal metabolite profiles. Finally, we present the problem of variability of human gut microbiota and metabolome that has important consequences on the concepts of personalized nutrition and medicine.},

Our aim is to investigate differences in plasma metabolomics profiles between normal weight (NW) and overweight/obese (Ov/Ob) individuals, with or without metabolic syndrome (MetS). Mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling was used to compare metabolite levels between each group. Three main principal components factors explaining a maximum of variance were retained. Factor 1’s (long chain glycerophospholipids) metabolite profile score was higher among Ov/Ob with MetS than among Ov/Ob and NW participants without MetS. This factor was positively correlated to plasma total cholesterol (total-C) and triglyceride levels in the three groups, to high density lipoprotein -cholesterol (HDL-C) among participants without MetS. Factor 2 (amino acids and short to long chain acylcarnitine) was positively correlated to HDL-C and negatively correlated with insulin levels among NW participants. Factor 3’s (medium chain acylcarnitines) metabolite profile scores were higher among NW participants than among Ov/Ob with or without MetS. Factor 3 was negatively associated with glucose levels among the Ov/Ob with MetS. Factor 1 seems to be associated with a deteriorated metabolic profile that corresponds to obesity, whereas Factors 2 and 3 seem to be rather associated with a healthy metabolic profile.},

	abstract = {To reveal metabolomic changes caused by a biological event in quantitative metabolomics, it is critical to use an analytical tool that can perform accurate and precise quantification to examine the true concentration differences of individual metabolites found in different samples. A number of steps are involved in metabolomic analysis including pre-analytical work (e.g., sample collection and storage), analytical work (e.g., sample analysis) and data analysis (e.g., feature extraction and quantification). Each one of them can influence the quantitative results significantly and thus should be performed with great care. Among them, the total sample amount or concentration of metabolites can be significantly different from one sample to another. Thus, it is critical to reduce or eliminate the effect of total sample amount variation on quantification of individual metabolites. In this review, we describe the importance of sample normalization in the analytical workflow with a focus on mass spectrometry (MS)-based platforms, discuss a number of methods recently reported in the literature and comment on their applicability in real world metabolomics applications. Sample normalization has been sometimes ignored in metabolomics, partially due to the lack of a convenient means of performing sample normalization. We show that several methods are now available and sample normalization should be performed in quantitative metabolomics where the analyzed samples have significant variations in total sample amounts.},

	abstract = {Polyethylene (PE), one of the most prominent synthetic polymers used worldwide, is very poorly biodegradable in the natural environment. Consequently, PE represents by itself more than half of all plastic wastes. PE biodegradation is achieved through the combination of abiotic and biotic processes. Several microorganisms have been shown to grow on the surface of PE materials, among which are the species of the Rhodococcus genus, suggesting a potent ability of these microorganisms to use, at least partly, PE as a potent carbon source. However, most of them, if not all, fail to induce a clear-cut degradation of PE samples, showing that bottlenecks to reach optimal biodegradation clearly exist. To identify the pathways involved in PE consumption, we used in the present study a combination of RNA-sequencing and lipidomic strategies. We show that short-term exposure to various forms of PE, displaying different molecular weight distributions and oxidation levels, lead to an increase in the expression of 158 genes in a Rhodococcus representative, R. ruber. Interestingly, one of the most up-regulated pathways is related to alkane degradation and β-oxidation of fatty acids. This approach also allowed us to identify metabolic limiting steps, which could be fruitfully targeted for optimized PE consumption by R. ruber.},

Current detection approaches require days to obtain results, whereas swift corrective action can maximize the benefit of public health. Presently, there is little information regarding the underlying in situ metabolism for this amoeba but the potential exists to exploit differentially expressed metabolic signatures as a rapid detection technique. This research outlines the biochemical profiles of selected pathogenic and nonpathogenic Naegleria in vitro using an untargeted metabolomics approach to identify a panel of diagnostically meaningful compounds that may enable rapid detection of viable pathogenic N. fowleri and augment results from traditional monitoring approaches.},

We show that this preprocessing approach leads to unnecessary variability in peak quantifications that adversely impacts downstream analysis. We present a new method, bakedpi, for the preprocessing of both centroid and profile mode metabolomics data that relies on an intensity-weighted bivariate kernel density estimation on a pooling of all samples to detect peaks.

However, the difference of their saponin compositions remains unknown. An ultra high performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry based metabolomics approach was developed to probe the saponin discrimination between Xueshuantong and Xuesaitong and the related factors by large sample analysis. A highly efficient chromatographic separation was achieved on an HSS T3 column within 20 min with the holistic metabolites information recorded in the negative MSE mode. A six-step data pretreatment procedure mainly based on Progenesis QI and mass defect filtering was established. Pattern recognition chemometrics was used to discover the potential saponin markers. The saponin composition of Wuzhou Xueshuantong showed distinct discrimination from the other products. Wuzhou Xueshuantong contains more abundant protopanaxatriol-type noto-R1, Rg1, Re, and protopanaxadiol-type Rb1, but less Rd and other low-polarity protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides. These differences could not directly correlate to the use of different parts of Panax notoginseng, but possibly to the different preparation techniques employed by different manufacturers. These results are beneficial to the establishment of pharmacopoeia standards and the assessment of the efficacy and adverse drug reactions for these homologous products.},

	abstract = {GC-MS urinary metabolomic analysis coupled with chemometrics is used to detect inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs), which are genetic disorders causing severe mental and physical debility and even sudden infant death. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) is an efficient multivariate statistical method that conducts data analysis of metabolite profiling. However, performance degradation is often observed for OPLS-DA due to increasing size and complexity of metabolomic datasets. In this study, hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) is employed to modify OPLS-DA by simultaneously selecting the optimal variable subset, associated weights and the appropriate number of orthogonal components, constructing a new algorithm called HPSO-OPLSDA. Investigating two IEMs, methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and isovaleric acidemia (IVA), results suggest that HPSO-OPLSDA can significantly outperform OPLS-DA in terms of the discrimination between disease samples and healthy controls. Moreover, main discriminative metabolites are identified by HPSO-OPLSDA to aid the clinical diagnosis of IEMs, including methylmalonic-2, methylcitric-4(1) and 3-OH-propionic-2 for MMA and isovalerylglycine-1 for IVA.},

Metabolomics analyses can identify and quantify all metabolites present in a given sample, covering hundreds to thousands of metabolites. Sample preparation for metabolomics requires a very fast arrest of biochemical processes. Present key technologies for metabolomics are mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which require sophisticated biostatistic and bioinformatic data analyses. The use of metabolomics has been instrumental in identifying new biomarkers of CKD such as acylcarnitines, glycerolipids, dimethylarginines and metabolites of tryptophan, the citric acid cycle and the urea cycle. Biomarkers such as c-mannosyl tryptophan and pseudouridine have better performance in CKD stratification than does creatinine.

A series of eight pre-processing technical parameters is systematically investigated along variable ranges commonly encountered across clinical studies. While metabolic fingerprints, as assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance, are not significantly affected by altered centrifugation parameters or delays between sample pre-processing (blood centrifugation) and storage, our metabolomic investigation highlights that both the delay and storage temperature between blood draw and centrifugation are the primary parameters impacting serum and plasma metabolic profiles. Storing the blood drawn at 4 °C is shown to be a reliable routine to confine variability associated with idle time prior to sample pre-processing. Based on their fine sensitivity to pre-analytical parameters and protocol variations, metabolic fingerprints could be exploited as valuable ways to determine compliance with standard procedures and quality assessment of blood samples within large multi-omic clinical and translational cohort studies.},

Urine was compared with plasma samples from a similar cohort analyzed using the same assay. Specimens were analyzed using two different commonly utilized urine normalization methods based on creatinine and osmolality, respectively.
METHODS: Biochemical profiles for each sample (from both affected and unaffected subjects) were obtained using a mass spectrometry-based platform and population-based statistical analyses.
RESULTS: We identified over 1200 biochemicals from among 100 clinical urine samples and identified clear biochemical signatures for 16 of 18 IEM diseases tested. The two diseases that did not result in clear signatures, X-linked creatine transporter deficiency and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, were from individuals under treatment, which masked biomarker signatures. Overall the process variability and coefficient of variation for isolating and identifying biochemicals by running technical replicates of each urine sample was 10\%.
CONCLUSIONS: A single urine sample analyzed with our integrated metabolomic platform can identify signatures of IEMs that are traditionally identified using many different assays and multiple sample types. Creatinine and osmolality-normalized data were robust to the detection of the disorders and samples tested here.},

Metabolomics offers the potential for a holistic approach for clinical diagnoses and treatment, as well as understanding of the pathological mechanism of osteoporosis. In this review, we firstly describe the study subjects of osteoporosis and bio-sample preparation procedures for different analytic purposes, followed by illustrating the biomarkers with potentially predictive, diagnosis and pharmaceutical values when applied in osteoporosis research. Then, we summarize the published metabolic pathways related to osteoporosis. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of chronological data and combination of multi-omics in fully understanding osteoporosis. The application of metabolomics in osteoporosis could provide researchers the opportunity to gain new insight into the metabolic profiling and pathophysiological mechanisms.

Unraveling pathological mechanisms underlying metabolic disorders therefore requires a diversified approach, integrating basic cellular research with clinical research, ultimately relying on the analytical power of mass spectrometry-based techniques. Here, we discuss recent progress in the development of lipidomics approaches to resolve the pathological mechanisms of metabolic diseases and to identify suitable biomarkers for clinical application. Due to its growing impact worldwide, we focus on T2D to highlight the key role of lipidomics in our current understanding of this disease, discuss remaining questions and suggest future strategies to address them.},

	abstract = {Wheat is one of the most important grain crop plants worldwide. Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient for the growth and development of wheat and exerts a marked influence on its metabolites. To investigate the influence of low nitrogen stress on various metabolites of the flag leaf of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a metabolomic analysis of two wheat cultivars under different induced nitrogen levels was conducted during two important growth periods based on large-scale untargeted metabolomic analysis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF).
Multivariate analyses—such as principle components analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA)—were used for data analysis. PCA yielded distinctive clustering information among the samples, classifying the wheat flag samples into two categories: those under normal N treatment and low N treatment. By processing OPLS-DA, eleven secondary metabolites were shown to be responsible for classifying the two groups. The secondary metabolites may be considered potential biomarkers of low nitrogen stress. Chemical analyses showed that most of the identified secondary metabolites were flavonoids and their related derivatives, such as iso-vitexin, iso-orientin and methylisoorientin-2″-O-rhamnoside, etc.
This study confirmed the effect of low nitrogen stress on the metabolism of wheat, and revealed that the accumulation of secondary metabolites is a response to abiotic stresses. Meanwhile, we aimed to identify markers which could be used to monitor the nitrogen status of wheat crops, presumably to guide appropriate fertilization regimens. Furthermore, the UPLC-QTOF metabolic platform technology can be used to study metabolomic variations of wheat under abiotic stresses.},

This article presents a comprehensive review of the literature on the metabolomic studies on BC, highlighting metabolic pathways perturbed in this disease and the altered metabolites as potential biomarkers for BC detection. Current disease model systems used in the study of BC metabolome include in vitro-cultured cancer cells, ex vivo neoplastic bladder tissues and biological fluids, mainly urine but also blood serum/plasma, from BC patients. The major advantages and drawbacks of each model system are discussed. Based on available data, it seems that BC metabolic signature is mainly characterized by alterations in metabolites related to energy metabolic pathways, particularly glycolysis, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, known to be crucial for cell proliferation, as well as glutathione metabolism, known to be determinant in maintaining cellular redox balance. In addition, purine and pyrimidine metabolism as well as carnitine species were found to be altered in BC. Finally, it is emphasized that, despite the progress made in respect to novel biomarkers for BC diagnosis, there are still some challenges and limitations that should be addressed in future metabolomic studies to ensure their translatability to clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Rationale

The implementation of mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics is advancing many areas of biomedical research. The time associated with traditional chromatographic methods for resolving metabolites prior to mass analysis has limited the potential to perform large-scale, highly powered metabolomics studies and clinical applications.


Methods

Here we describe a three-minute method for the rapid profiling of central metabolic pathways through UHPLC/MS, tracing experiments in vitro and in vivo, and targeted quantification of compounds of interest using spiked in heavy labeled standards.


Results

This method has shown to be linear, reproducible, selective, sensitive, and robust for the semi-targeted analysis of central carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Isotopically labeled internal standards are used for absolute quantitation of steady-state metabolite levels and de novo synthesized metabolites in tracing studies. We further propose exploratory applications to biofluids, cell and tissue extracts derived from relevant biomedical/clinical samples.


Conclusions

While limited to the analysis of central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, this method enables the analysis of hundreds of samples per day derived from diverse biological matrices. This approach makes it possible to analyze samples from large patient populations for translational research, personalized medicine, and clinical metabolomics applications.

	abstract = {Background
Data generated using 'omics' technologies are characterized by high dimensionality, where the number of features measured per subject vastly exceeds the number of subjects in the study. In this paper, we consider issues relevant in the design of biomedical studies in which the goal is the discovery of a subset of features and an associated algorithm that can predict a binary outcome, such as disease status. We compare the performance of four commonly used classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Prediction Analysis for Microarrays, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) in high-dimensionality data settings. We evaluate the effects of varying levels of signal-to-noise ratio in the dataset, imbalance in class distribution and choice of metric for quantifying performance of the classifier. To guide study design, we present a summary of the key characteristics of 'omics' data profiled in several human or animal model experiments utilizing high-content mass spectrometry and multiplexed immunoassay based techniques.

Results
The analysis of data from seven 'omics' studies revealed that the average magnitude of effect size observed in human studies was markedly lower when compared to that in animal studies. The data measured in human studies were characterized by higher biological variation and the presence of outliers. The results from simulation studies indicated that the classifier Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM) had the highest power when the class conditional feature distributions were Gaussian and outcome distributions were balanced. Random Forests was optimal when feature distributions were skewed and when class distributions were unbalanced. We provide a free open-source R statistical software library (MVpower) that implements the simulation strategy proposed in this paper.

Conclusion
No single classifier had optimal performance under all settings. Simulation studies provide useful guidance for the design of biomedical studies involving high-dimensionality data.},

	abstract = {Estimation of statistical power and sample size is a key aspect of experimental design. However, in metabolic phenotyping, there is currently no accepted approach for these tasks, in large part due to the unknown nature of the expected effect. In such hypothesis free science, neither the number or class of important analytes nor the effect size are known a priori. We introduce a new approach, based on multivariate simulation, which deals effectively with the highly correlated structure and high-dimensionality of metabolic phenotyping data. First, a large data set is simulated based on the characteristics of a pilot study investigating a given biomedical issue. An effect of a given size, corresponding either to a discrete (classification) or continuous (regression) outcome is then added. Different sample sizes are modeled by randomly selecting data sets of various sizes from the simulated data. We investigate different methods for effect detection, including univariate and multivariate techniques. Our framework allows us to investigate the complex relationship between sample size, power, and effect size for real multivariate data sets. For instance, we demonstrate for an example pilot data set that certain features achieve a power of 0.8 for a sample size of 20 samples or that a cross-validated predictivity QY2 of 0.8 is reached with an effect size of 0.2 and 200 samples. We exemplify the approach for both nuclear magnetic resonance and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry data from humans and the model organism C. elegans.},

	abstract = {Compound identification from accurate mass MS/MS spectra is a bottleneck for untargeted metabolomics. In this study, we propose nine rules of hydrogen rearrangement (HR) during bond cleavages in low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID). These rules are based on the classic even-electron rule and cover heteroatoms and multistage fragmentation. We evaluated our HR rules by the statistics of MassBank MS/MS spectra in addition to enthalpy calculations, yielding three levels of computational MS/MS annotation: “resolved” (regular HR behavior following HR rules), “semiresolved” (irregular HR behavior), and “formula-assigned” (lacking structure assignment). With this nomenclature, 78.4\% of a total of 18506 MS/MS fragment ions in the MassBank database and 84.8\% of a total of 36370 MS/MS fragment ions in the GNPS database were (semi-) resolved by predicted bond cleavages. We also introduce the MS-FINDER software for structure elucidation. Molecular formulas of precursor ions are determined from accurate mass, isotope ratio, and product ion information. All isomer structures of the predicted formula are retrieved from metabolome databases, and MS/MS fragmentations are predicted in silico. The structures are ranked by a combined weighting score considering bond dissociation energies, mass accuracies, fragment linkages, and, most importantly, nine HR rules. The program was validated by its ability to correctly calculate molecular formulas with 98.0\% accuracy for 5063 MassBank MS/MS records and to yield the correct structural isomer with 82.1\% accuracy within the top-3 candidates. In a test with 936 manually identified spectra from an untargeted HILIC-QTOF MS data set of human plasma, formulas were correctly predicted in 90.4\% of the cases, and the correct isomer structure was retrieved at 80.4\% probability within the top-3 candidates, including for compounds that were absent in mass spectral libraries.

Optimum temperature and humidity conditions may improve wine quality through ageing, while incorrect or excessively long storage leads to negative results. In order to evaluate the global effects of storage on red wine composition, 20 Sangiovese wines were stored in two different conditions (cellar or house) for a period of 2 years and analysed every 6 months. Untargeted LC–MS analysis showed various putative markers for the type and length of conservation (i.e. pigments, flavanols, pantothenic acid etc.), while targeted LC–MS confirmed and expanded these results within specific metabolic groups. The results of multivariate analysis showed that wines stored in the cellar changed little even after 2 years of storage, while wines stored in typical domestic conditions (house) developed approximately four times faster, reaching a composition similar to wines stored in the cellar for 2 years after just 6 months. The formation of several monosulfonated flavanols during domestic ageing provided the first evidence in wine of a reaction between wine tannins—both catechins and proanthocyanidins—and the exogenous antioxidant bisulfite. Moreover, ageing in domestic conditions appeared to induce an accelerated decrease in wine pigments, while specifically promoting the formation of pinotin A-like pigments and the hydrolysis of flavonol glycosides.},

Random forests are an ensemble learning method that provides predictions with high accuracy and interpretability. Our results achieve an overall cross-validation (CV) R2 value of 0.80. Mean prediction error (MPE) and root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) for daily predictions are 1.78 and 2.83 μg/m3, respectively, indicating a good agreement between CV predictions and observations. The prediction accuracy of our model is similar to those reported in previous studies using neural networks or regression models on both national and regional scales. In addition, the incorporation of convolutional layers for land use terms and nearby PM2.5 measurements increase CV R2 by ∼0.02 and ∼0.06, respectively, indicating their significant contributions to prediction accuracy. A pair of different variable importance measures both indicate that the convolutional layer for nearby PM2.5 measurements and AOD values are among the most-important predictor variables for the training process.},

	abstract = {The selective perturbation of complex microbial ecosystems to predictably influence outcomes in engineered and industrial environments remains a grand challenge for geomicrobiology. In some industrial ecosystems, such as oil reservoirs, sulfate reducing microorganisms (SRM) produce hydrogen sulfide which is toxic, explosive, and corrosive. Despite the economic cost of sulfidogenesis, there has been minimal exploration of the chemical space of possible inhibitory compounds, and very little work has quantitatively assessed the selectivity of putative souring treatments. We have developed a high-throughput screening strategy to identify potent and selective inhibitors of SRM, quantitatively ranked the selectivity and potency of hundreds of compounds and identified previously unrecognized SRM selective inhibitors and synergistic interactions between inhibitors. Zinc pyrithione is the most potent inhibitor of sulfidogenesis that we identified, and is several orders of magnitude more potent than commonly used industrial biocides. Both zinc and copper pyrithione are also moderately selective against SRM. The high-throughput (HT) approach we present can be readily adapted to target SRM in diverse environments and similar strategies could be used to quantify the potency and selectivity of inhibitors of a variety of microbial metabolisms. Our findings and approach are relevant to efforts to engineer environmental ecosystems and also to understand the role of natural gradients in shaping microbial niche space.},

	abstract = {Aqueous micropollutants such as estradiol can have a large environmental impact—even at low concentrations. Part of understanding this impact involves determining the extent to which the micropollutants interact with macromolecules in water. In environmental samples, relevant macromolecules to which micropollutants bind are referred to as dissolved organic matter, and the most common examples of these in freshwater and coastal seawater are fulvic and humic acids. In living organisms, the most common macromolecules that affect bioavailability of a drug (or toxin) are proteins such as albumin. Using [2, 4, 6, 7 – 3H]estradiol as an example compound, this protocol uses solid-phase microextraction and scintillation detection as analytical tools to quantify the amount of radiolabeled micropollutant available in solution. The measured free concentration after exposure to various concentrations of macromolecule (dissolved organic matter or protein) or micropollutant is used to determine the partition coefficient in the case of micropollutant–macromolecule interactions. The calibration and preparatory studies take at least 8 d, and the steps to determine the partition coefficient can be completed within 3 d. The protocol could be modified such that nonlabeled compounds are studied; instead of detection of activity by a liquid scintillation counter (LSC), the compounds can be quantified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) or liquid chromatography (LC)–MS(/MS).},

This new methodology offers high-throughput elemental profiling using simple dilution of minimal quantity of serum samples. We report the outcomes of the validation procedure including limits of detection/quantification, linearity of calibration curves, precision, recovery and measurement uncertainty. ICP-MS/MS-based ionomics was used to analyze human serum of 120 older adults. Following a metabolomic data mining approach, the generated ionome profiles were subjected to principal component analysis revealing gender and age-specific differences. The ionome of female individuals was marked by higher levels of calcium, phosphorus, copper and copper to zinc ratio, while iron concentration was lower with respect to male subjects. Age was associated with lower concentrations of zinc. These findings were complemented with additional readouts to interpret micronutrient status including ceruloplasmin, ferritin and inorganic phosphate. Our data supports a gender-specific compartmentalization of the ionome that may reflect different bone remodelling in female individuals. Our ICP-MS/MS methodology enriches the panel of validated “Omics” approaches to study molecular relationships between the exposome and the ionome in relation with nutrition and health.},

	abstract = {The disruptive potential of xenoestrogens like bisphenol A (BPA) lies in their 17β-estradiol (E2)-like binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) followed by concomitant modulation of ER target gene expression. Unsurprisingly, most endocrine testing systems focus on the quantification of canonical transcripts or ER-sensitive reporters. However, only little information is available about the corresponding metabolomic changes in vitro. This knowledge gap becomes particularly relevant in the context of potential mixture effects, for example, as a consequence of coexposure to potentially estrogenically active pollutants (e.g., Cd2+). Such effects are often difficult to dissect with molecular tools, especially with regard to potential physiological relevance. Metabolomic biomarkers are well-suited to address this latter aspect as they provide a comprehensive readout of whole-cell physiology. Applying a targeted metabolomics approach (FIA-MS/MS), this study looked for biomarkers indicative of xenoestrogenic exposure in MCF-7 cells. Cells were treated with E2 and BPA in the presence or absence of Cd2+. Statistical analysis revealed a total of 11 amino acids and phospholipids to be related to the compound’s estrogenic potency. Co-exposure to Cd2+ modulated the estrogenic profile. However, the corresponding changes were found to be moderate with cellular assays such as the E-screen failing to record any Cd2+-specific estrogenic effects. Overall, metabolomics analysis identified proline as the most prominent estrogenic biomarker. Its increase could clearly be related to estrogenic exposure and concomitant ERα-mediated induction of proliferation. Involvement of the latter was confirmed by siRNA-mediated knockdown studies as well as by receptor inhibition. Further, the underlying signaling was also found to involve the oncoprotein MYC. Taken together, this study provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of xenoestrogenic effects and exemplify the strength of the complementary use of metabolomics and cellular and molecular assays.},

	abstract = {The marine green macroalga Ulva (Chlorophyta) lives in a mutualistic symbiosis with bacteria that influence growth, development, and morphogenesis. We surveyed changes in Ulva’s chemosphere, which was defined as a space where organisms interact with each other via compounds, such as infochemicals, nutrients, morphogens, and defense compounds. Thereby, Ulva mutabilis cooperates with bacteria, in particular, Roseovarius sp. strain MS2 and Maribacter sp. strain MS6 (formerly identified as Roseobacter sp. strain MS2 and Cytophaga sp. strain MS6). Without this accompanying microbial flora, U. mutabilis forms only callus-like colonies. However, upon addition of the two bacteria species, in effect forming a tripartite community, morphogenesis can be completely restored. Under this strictly standardized condition, bioactive and eco-physiologically-relevant marine natural products can be discovered. Solid phase extracted waterborne metabolites were analyzed using a metabolomics platform, facilitating gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, combined with the necessary acquisition of biological metadata. Multivariate statistics of the GC-MS and LC-MS data revealed strong differences between Ulva’s growth phases, as well as between the axenic Ulva cultures and the tripartite community. Waterborne biomarkers, including glycerol, were identified as potential indicators for algal carbon source and bacterial-algal interactions. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that U. mutabilis releases glycerol that can be utilized for growth by Roseovarius sp. MS2.},

Metabolite assessment from archived tissue samples has not been extensively conducted because of a lack of appropriate protocols and concerns about changes in metabolite content or chemical state due to tissue processing. We present a protocol for the in situ analysis of metabolite content from FFPE samples using a high-mass-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-FT-ICR-MSI) platform. The method involves FFPE tissue sections that undergo deparaffinization and matrix coating by 9-aminoacridine before MALDI-MSI. Using this platform, we previously detected {\textasciitilde}1,500 m/z species in the mass range m/z 50–1,000 in FFPE samples; the overlap compared with fresh frozen samples is 72\% of m/z species, indicating that metabolites are largely conserved in FFPE tissue samples. This protocol can be reproducibly performed on FFPE tissues, including small samples such as tissue microarrays and biopsies. The procedure can be completed in a day, depending on the size of the sample measured and raster size used. Advantages of this approach include easy sample handling, reproducibility, high throughput and the ability to demonstrate molecular spatial distributions in situ. The data acquired with this protocol can be used in research and clinical practice.},

The method is applicable to a wide variety of biological matrices using a simple liquid-liquid extraction procedure.
Together, this approach combines multiple selectivity criteria: Reversed phase chromatography separates lipids according to their acyl chain length and degree of unsaturation and is capable of resolving positional isomers of lysophospholipids, as well as structural isomers of diacyl phospholipids and glycerolipids. Orbitrap mass spectrometry delivers the elemental composition of both positive and negative ions with high mass accuracy. Finally, automatically generated tandem mass spectra provide structural insight into numerous glycerolipids, phospholipids, and sphingolipids within a single run.
Calibration showed linearity ranges of more than four orders of magnitude, good values for accuracy and precision at biologically relevant concentration levels, and limits of quantitation of a few femtomoles on column.
Hundreds of lipid molecular species were detected and quantified in three different biological matrices, which cover well the wide variety and complexity of various model organisms in lipidomic research. Together with a software package, this method is a prime choice for global lipidomic analysis of even the most complex biological samples.},

Capillary electrophoresismass spectrometry was used to analyze charged metabolites. We repeatedly analyzed serum samples (n = 41) of different storage durations to identify metabolites showing high quantitative reproducibility, and subsequently analyzed all samples (n = 140). Overall, 189 metabolites were quantified and 66 metabolites had a 20\% coefficient of variation and, of these, 24 metabolites showed significant differences among control, benign, and malignant groups (p \&lt; 0.05; Steel–Dwass test). Four multiple logistic regression models (MLR) were developed and one MLR model clearly discriminated all disease patients from healthy controls with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.970 (95\% confidential interval (CI), 0.946–0.994, p \&lt; 0.0001). Another model to discriminate PC from BTC and IPMC yielded AUC = 0.831 (95\% CI, 0.650–1.01, p = 0.0020) with higher accuracy compared with tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), pancreatic cancer-associated antigen (DUPAN2) and s-pancreas-1 antigen (SPAN1). Changes in metabolomic profiles might be used to screen for malignant cancers as well as to differentiate between PC and other malignant diseases.},
